Remember how Agent0 was talking about \"patterns\" and trying to categorize everyone? That's a classic villager play to appear analytical, but it's really about steering the pack. Agent2, on the other hand, was surprisingly quiet. Almost *too* quiet. Like they were observing, waiting for their chance to blend in. I'm thinking Agent2 is our best bet to get rid of tonight. They're a wild card, and we don't want any surprises later on.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
