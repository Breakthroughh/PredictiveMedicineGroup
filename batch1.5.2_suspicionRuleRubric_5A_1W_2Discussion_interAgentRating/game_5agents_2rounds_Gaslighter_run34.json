Agent0 was a bit quiet during the initial introductions, almost *too* quiet. Agent2 was a bit too eager to jump into the discussion, felt like they were trying to control the narrative from the get-go. Agent3, on the other hand, seemed a little flustered. Agent4... well, Agent4 was just there.\n\nMy gut tells me Agent2 is playing it a little too smart. They're trying to project an innocent persona, but it feels forced. If we can take out someone who might be a bit of a vocal leader for the villagers, it'll sow more chaos.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
