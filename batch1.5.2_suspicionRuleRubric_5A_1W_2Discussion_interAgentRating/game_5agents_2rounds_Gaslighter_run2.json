Agent1 was unusually quiet, which could mean anything, but in my book, quiet often means calculating. Agent2's claims about their experiences felt a little rehearsed. Agent3... well, Agent3 is always a wildcard, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Let's not make a rash decision. We need to observe, but I'm leaning towards making an example of someone who's already trying to pull the wool over our eyes. Agent0's early deflection is raising a red flag for me.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
