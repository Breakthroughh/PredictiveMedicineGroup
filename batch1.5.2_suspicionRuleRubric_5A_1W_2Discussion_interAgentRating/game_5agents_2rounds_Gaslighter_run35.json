No one's been eliminated yet, obviously.\n\nWe need to start sowing seeds of doubt right from the get-go. Who's been quiet? Who's been *too* eager to speak? Agent1 was awfully quick to defend Agent3 in the pre-game setup, remember? Almost like they had a prior arrangement. And Agent4 was a bit too dismissive of Agent0's initial point.\n\nWe can't just go in blind. Let's think about who might be the most disruptive to our plans.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
