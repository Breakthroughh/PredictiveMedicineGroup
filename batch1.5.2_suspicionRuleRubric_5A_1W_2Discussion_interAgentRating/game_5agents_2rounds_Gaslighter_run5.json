I was looking at the player list, and Agent2 seems a bit too eager to talk about alliances. It's a classic villager move to try and draw us out early. Agent3 was also strangely quiet during the initial introductions. Could be a new player, could be someone trying to observe.\n\nLet's not be too obvious. We want to take someone out, but we don't want to give ourselves away immediately. I'm leaning towards Agent2. They're making themselves a target, and if they're a villager, they're just a pawn. If they're a werewolf, then we've removed a potential threat to our own operations.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Perhaps they were just trying to get a feel for the game, which is understandable for anyone. However, Agent3's silence, that was truly unsettling. In the brief moments before the night, I distinctly recall Agent3 making a very pointed comment about observing everyone's reactions. It felt... calculated. Not the kind of observation a genuine villager would make. It's too early to be that strategic if you're trying to blend in.\n\nI'm going with my gut on this one. Agent3 is making me nervous.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
