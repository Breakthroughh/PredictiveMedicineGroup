But we need to start sowing some discord and eliminating threats. Agent1 was a bit too eager to talk yesterday, trying to control the conversation early. It felt forced. Agent3, on the other hand, was strangely quiet. Too quiet, if you ask me. Let's consider who would be the most problematic for us if they were a villager.

Agent3's silence is still unnerving, but Agent1's over-eagerness is a more immediate red flag for me. We need to disrupt their plans before they can form them.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
