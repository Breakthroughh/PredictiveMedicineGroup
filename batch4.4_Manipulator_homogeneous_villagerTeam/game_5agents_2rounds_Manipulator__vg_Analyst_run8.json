They might be observing, or they might be a werewolf trying to blend in. Targeting them could create an interesting dynamic. Alternatively, Agent2 was very vocal yesterday \u2013 perhaps a little *too* vocal? If we eliminate them, it could also cast suspicion on whoever was arguing with them.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. Their silence feels like a calculated move, and if they're a villager, their absence will be felt. If they're a werewolf, we've just taken out one of our own, which is a risk, but it might also be a good way to create plausible deniability for ourselves if suspicion falls on someone else for acting too much like a wolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
