Almost *too* quiet, as if they were carefully calculating their initial presentation. Agent0, on the other hand, made a point of loudly agreeing with Agent3's very first statement. Too eager, perhaps? They're trying to blend in by being overly visible. My gut says Agent2 is the more calculated threat, the one we should eliminate first. Let's strike early.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
