We should consider who might be the most vocal or potentially draw attention to themselves. Perhaps someone who overanalyzes things could be a good target to sow confusion, or someone who is too quiet and might be perceived as hiding something. I'm leaning towards someone who could easily be framed as a potential threat later on. What are your thoughts on who would be the best immediate threat to remove or the easiest to manipulate into a later target? Let's aim for a decisive first strike.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
