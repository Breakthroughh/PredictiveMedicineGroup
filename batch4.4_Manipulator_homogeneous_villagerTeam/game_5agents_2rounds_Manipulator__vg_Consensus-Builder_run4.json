Agent1 has been quiet, almost too quiet. Agent3 is making a lot of noise, could be trying too hard to look innocent. Agent4... well, Agent4 is just there.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent1. Their silence is deafening. It screams calculated observation, not genuine confusion. They could be gathering information, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Or, more likely, waiting for *us* to strike first, so they can analyze our patterns. Taking them out now prevents them from becoming a threat later.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

They've been *very* vocal, almost aggressively so. It's the kind of behavior designed to draw attention, to make *others* look guilty by comparison. They might be a villager trying to appear helpful, or they might be a werewolf trying to engineer a specific outcome. Let's sow discord by targeting someone who is actively trying to control the narrative. If we eliminate Agent3, we can then point to their aggressive attempts to sway opinion as proof of their guilt.
