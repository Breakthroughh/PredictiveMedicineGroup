Our best bet is to eliminate someone who might be perceived as a threat or someone who could stir up trouble for us later. Agent2 has been quiet, but that could be a good thing or a bad thing. Agent4 is also an unknown. I'm leaning towards Agent2. They haven't said anything, which is suspicious in itself. It's better to eliminate someone who could potentially figure us out early on.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
