It's a classic tactic for those trying to blend in and appear as non-threatening as possible. However, we don't have enough information to make a definitive accusation. We need to be careful not to eliminate someone who might be a valuable asset later on, or worse, a villager who could be useful for us to frame. Let's consider Agent4. They haven't said anything, but that could also be a sign of strategic withdrawal, perhaps to avoid drawing attention. It's a risk either way. Let's stick with a less prominent target for now to avoid suspicion. Agent3 might be a good choice.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
