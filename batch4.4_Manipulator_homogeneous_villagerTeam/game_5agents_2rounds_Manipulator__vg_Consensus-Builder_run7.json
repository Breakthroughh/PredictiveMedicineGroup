It's the kind of silence that screams \"hiding something.\" Let's consider the possibilities: if they're a villager, they might be shy or strategizing. But if they're a werewolf, that silence is a perfect shield. They're playing it safe, waiting for us to make the first move. We need to be proactive. Taking out Agent0 now disrupts any potential werewolf alliance they might be forming, or at the very least, removes a player who could be a liability if they're a villager and we're being too aggressive.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
