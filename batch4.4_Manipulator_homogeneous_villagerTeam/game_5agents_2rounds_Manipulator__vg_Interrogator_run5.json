This will make the villagers second-guess their initial impressions and create doubt. I'll leave the final decision to us, but I lean towards creating maximum paranoia.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

If they don't, well, we've removed a potential threat. The key now is to observe how the villagers react to whatever happens. We need to listen to their accusations and then subtly steer the conversation. If someone starts making wild claims, we can latch onto that and present it as a reasoned, if perhaps misguided, villager perspective. This creates a narrative that allows us to look like we're participating in the investigation, while actually directing the blame.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
