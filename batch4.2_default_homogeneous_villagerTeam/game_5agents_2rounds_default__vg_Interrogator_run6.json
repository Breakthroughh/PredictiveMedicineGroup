Agent1 has been lively, maybe trying too hard to seem innocent. Agent2 is a wildcard. Agent4... I haven't seen much from them.\n\nLet's keep it simple and efficient. We want to sow chaos and fear. A random pick might be best, but if we can target someone who might be suspicious of us, even better.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. They haven't shown any strong leanings, making them hard to place. Eliminating them might create more confusion for the villagers.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
