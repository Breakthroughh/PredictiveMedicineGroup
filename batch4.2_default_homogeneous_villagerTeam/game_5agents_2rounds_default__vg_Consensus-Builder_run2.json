My goal is to kill all villagers.\n\nSince this is Night 1, no one knows anything for sure yet. We need to be strategic with our first kill. We don't want to draw too much attention to ourselves. Killing someone too suspicious might be too obvious, and killing someone too quiet might not achieve much.\n\nAgent0 and Agent1 seem like safe bets to keep the villagers guessing. Agent2 has been a bit too quiet for my liking, but maybe that's just them playing it safe. Agent3 is also a bit of an unknown.\n\nI think we should target someone who might seem slightly suspicious to the villagers, but not so much that it's a clear werewolf move.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
