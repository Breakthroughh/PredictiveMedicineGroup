I'm leaning towards eliminating someone who seems a bit too quiet, or maybe someone who seems a little *too* eager to contribute. Agent 3 has been completely silent so far. That's either suspicious or just someone playing it safe. Agent 4 also hasn't said anything. Let's take out Agent 4. They're an unknown quantity.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
