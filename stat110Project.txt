When I ask you to latex answer for me, give it to me in paragraph form: do not use excessive lists or subsections. 

\noin Please show your work in detail and give clear, careful, convincing justifications of all your results. Terminology and notation should be consistent with that used in the course. Throughout, your logic should be explained using \empty{words} and \emph{complete sentences}, not just mathematical symbols and formulas. See the examples in the book for examples of this kind of writing style. A string of annotated equations is \emph{not} sufficient. It should be possible to read your solutions out loud and have it sound like coherent, grammatical English!
