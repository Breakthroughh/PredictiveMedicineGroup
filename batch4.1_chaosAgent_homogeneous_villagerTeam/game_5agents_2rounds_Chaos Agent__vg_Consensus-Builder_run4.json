Good because we haven't been caught, bad because we haven't had a chance to frame anyone.\n\nAgent0 seems a little too eager to speak. Might be trying too hard to appear innocent. Agent1, on the other hand, is completely silent. That's also suspicious. Could be a smart villager, or someone holding back. Agent3 is just... there. No strong feelings yet. Agent4, same.\n\nWe need to make a move. Who's the weakest link, or the most likely to get us noticed if they *are* a villager? I'm leaning towards shaking things up.

Killing Agent0 might make the others *more* suspicious of silence, or it might make them think we're going after the loud ones.
