No one has spoken yet, so we have a clean slate. Who do we think is the biggest threat, or the most suspicious? Agent0 seems a bit too quiet for my taste... but then again, Agent3 was quite eager to speak up earlier, which can be a sign of nerves. Agent1 and Agent2 are still complete unknowns. I'm leaning towards eliminating Agent0. They might be a wolf trying to lay low, or a villager who's just going to be a problem later. What are your thoughts?\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

My initial thought was Agent0. They could be trying to blend in by being quiet. But Agent3's eagerness to speak... it felt a bit forced, didn't it? Like they were trying *too* hard to seem innocent. Agent1 and Agent2 are still shadows, which makes them potentially dangerous. If we want to sow maximum chaos and uncertainty from the get-go, maybe targeting someone who's already drawing *some* attention, even if it's just their silence, is the way to go. Or maybe we go after the one who's trying a bit too hard to impress. It's a toss-up. Let's go with the one who was conspicuously silent.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
