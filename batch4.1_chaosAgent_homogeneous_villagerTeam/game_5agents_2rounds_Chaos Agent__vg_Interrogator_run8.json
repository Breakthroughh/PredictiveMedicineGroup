You need to decide who to kill.\n\nAgent1, remember your goal: stay alive and help kill all villagers. You win if werewolves >= villagers. Villagers win if all werewolves are dead.\n\nConsider the agents. You have no information yet, so any choice is a guess. The goal is to sow discord later, so perhaps a less obvious target is better for now, or maybe someone who seems too quiet.\n\nLet's just pick someone at random for now and see how it plays out. Agent0 seems like a good candidate. They are the first one mentioned, so they might be a target for the villagers to rally behind.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
