If we take one out, we're at 4 alive, and if they vote someone out tomorrow, it's 3 vs 2. Perfect.\n\nAgent0 seems a bit too quiet, but that could be a trick. Agent2 was very defensive earlier when someone mentioned suspicion. Agent3 is trying to be the leader, but that might just be a facade. Agent4... I don't have much on them yet.\n\nLet's think. We want to cause maximum chaos and avoid suspicion falling on us. Taking out someone who seems *too* helpful might be a good play, or someone who's making too much noise.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. Their defensiveness felt a little... much. It could be a sign they're trying to hide something, or maybe they're just genuinely trying to survive. But a panicked villager is a scared villager. Taking them out might unnerve the others.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

They were quite vocal and seemed a bit too eager to point fingers, which could be a double bluff.\n\nHowever, what if we go for Agent3? They're very actively trying to steer the conversation, and that can sometimes draw attention away from themselves. If we take out someone who's trying to control the narrative, it might throw everyone else off balance more effectively. It's a more aggressive move, and might create more immediate distrust among the villagers.\n\nAgent0 is still a mystery, but I feel like striking at someone trying to lead the charge is a better use of our one kill.
