We need to make a strong first move to sow discord from the get-go. Who do we think is the most threatening, or the most likely to be a villager with a strong conviction? I'm leaning towards making an example of someone who seems a bit too eager to lead. Agent0 has been quiet, which could be anything. Agent1, Agent2, and Agent4 are all wild cards at this stage. I'm not seeing any obvious targets from their limited interactions, or lack thereof. Let's not be predictable. Let's go after someone who might try to rally the others too quickly.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
