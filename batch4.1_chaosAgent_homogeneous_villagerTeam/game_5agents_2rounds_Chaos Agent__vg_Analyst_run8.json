No one knows anything. We have a clean slate to work with. Who's the weakest link? Or, more importantly, who is least likely to raise suspicion *against us* if they survive? We don't want anyone too prominent, too quiet, or too vocal right out of the gate.\n\nAgent0 has been quiet so far. Could be good, could be a silent threat. Agent2, also a bit of an unknown. Agent3... was he *too* eager to point fingers in the past (if he had any past)? Agent4, on the other hand, is often quite loud in these games. Loud can be good for us \u2013 it distracts. But it can also draw attention.\n\nLet's be pragmatic. Who is the most *expendable* in terms of causing immediate alarm? I'm leaning towards someone who might be seen as a bit of an outlier, or someone whose absence wouldn't immediately scream \"werewolf attack\" to the villagers.\n\nI'm thinking Agent3. He hasn't established himself yet, and his elimination might be attributed to some early villager paranoia. It's a calculated risk, but better than a bold move that immediately makes us targets.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

But let's consider the implications. If we *don't* go for him, what's the alternative? Agent0 is too quiet, could be playing it safe. Agent2 is a blank slate, and frankly, I don't like blank slates. Agent4 is the wildcard.\n\nWhat if we play it *really* subtle this time? What if we eliminate someone who might appear to be a *strong* villager? Someone who might get *too* much attention, too soon, and become a target for *other* villagers? That would be a win-win for us \u2013 they're gone, and the villagers think they're cleaning house.\n\nLet's flip this. Agent4 is usually the most vocal. If Agent4 disappears, the villagers might assume a strong wolf took them out. But if Agent2 disappears, who would even notice? It's almost too subtle.\n\nMy initial thought on Agent3 still holds weight. Let's stick with that for now, unless there's a compelling reason to shake things up drastically. We don't want to overthink this on Night 1.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent4, on the other hand, seemed a bit flustered after their attempts to pin suspicion on me and Agent0. They called my statement observational, which is technically true, but their attempt to leverage that against me was weak.\n\nWe need to take out one of the remaining villagers. Agent0's quiet, calculating approach is more concerning long-term than Agent4's more visible, albeit clumsy, attempts at manipulation. If Agent0 survives, they could be a real problem.

Agent4, on the other hand, is a bit more transparent in their confusion and attempts to analyze. Their interactions with me and Agent0 in the last round showed a bit of a struggle to understand the shifting dynamics, but it didn't feel inherently deceptive.\n\nIf we eliminate Agent0, Agent4 might be easier to manage or even to frame. If we eliminate Agent4, Agent0 will likely play the victim and try to rally support. Agent0\u2019s calculated silence feels more like a threat than Agent4\u2019s visible struggles.
