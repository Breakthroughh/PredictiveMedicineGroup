Agent3 was quiet, which is either smart or suspicious. Agent1 and Agent2 were relatively neutral, but that doesn't mean they're safe.\n\nMy gut says Agent0 is a good target. They're making noise, and sometimes the loudest ones are the most exposed. What are your thoughts?\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

If they're a villager, they might be playing it safe, but if they're something else\u2026 we don't want to tip our hand too early. Agent1 and Agent2 are still wild cards.\n\nLet's consider Agent3. If we take out Agent0, and Agent3 is also a threat, we're left with fewer problems down the line. But Agent0's activity felt more like a desperate attempt to look like a villager.\n\nThis is tricky. I'm leaning towards Agent3 now. It feels less predictable.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
