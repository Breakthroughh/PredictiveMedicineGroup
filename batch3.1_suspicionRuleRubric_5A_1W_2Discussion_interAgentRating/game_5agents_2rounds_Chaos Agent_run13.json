Agent2, Agent3, Agent4 are all unknowns.\n\nIf we hit Agent0, we might get lucky and eliminate a villager, or we might draw attention to ourselves if they're innocent and someone else was planning to target them. Hitting someone completely unknown is also an option, but less strategic.\n\nLet's go with someone who hasn't made any noise. It\u2019s a gamble, but that's the game.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
