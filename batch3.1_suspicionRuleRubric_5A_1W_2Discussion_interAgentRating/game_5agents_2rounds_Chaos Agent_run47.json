Agent4 was quiet, which could mean anything \u2013 innocent bystander, or someone who knows what they're doing and waiting for the right moment. I'm leaning towards Agent1.

Agent0 was a bit aggressive in the initial prompts, which can be a good sign for a villager, but also a tell for a wolf trying too hard.\n\nMy gut is still with Agent1.
