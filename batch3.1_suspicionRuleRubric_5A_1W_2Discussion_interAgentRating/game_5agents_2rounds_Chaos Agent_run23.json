Agent0 seems a bit too eager, too vocal for a villager. Agent1 is suspiciously quiet. Agent2, meanwhile, is making waves with some very pointed, yet vague, accusations. That makes them a prime target for suspicion *after* we make our move.\n\nLet's make Agent0 disappear. They're loud, and a loud villager can be dangerous. Removing them early will make the remaining villagers question their own safety and their ability to trust.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
