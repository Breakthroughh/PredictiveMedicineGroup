Agent3 and Agent4 haven't said much, making them harder to read.\n\nFor our first kill, we need to create some early chaos and sow discord. Targeting someone who hasn't revealed much might be too risky; it could make us seem obvious if they turn out to be a valuable villager. Let's go after someone who might be a vocal villager, someone who could potentially rally others.

If we hit Agent2, and they *were* a villager, it might just make others more cautious.\n\nWhat if we target Agent0? They've been completely silent. That silence could mean they're a quiet, observant villager who's just watching, or it could mean they're a wolf trying to lay low. Either way, eliminating them without much information could really throw the villagers off balance. It creates an unknown void.\n\nLet's shake things up.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
