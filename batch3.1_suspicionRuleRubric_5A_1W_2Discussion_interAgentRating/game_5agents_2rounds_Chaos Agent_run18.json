Almost practiced.\n\nAgent1 was very vocal, trying to establish control. Could be a leader, or overcompensating.\n\nAgent2... I didn't get a strong read on them yet. Could be anyone.\n\nAgent4 was quick to offer an opinion, but it was a bit generic.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. If they're trying to play innocent, taking them out early might throw the villagers off their guard. Or maybe Agent1, to sow discord?\n\nLet's not overthink this. Who do we want to remove from the board first?\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
