Agent1 has been quiet so far, which could mean they're observing, or it could mean they're a wolf playing it safe. Agent2's silence could also be a tactic. Agent3 and Agent4 haven't really given us anything to go on either.\n\nI'm leaning towards taking out someone who seems *too* eager to fit in, or someone who is completely silent. It's a coin toss right now, but we need to make a move. Let's eliminate the unpredictable.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

They could be calculating their moves, waiting for the opportune moment to strike or to appear innocent. Agent3's silence is also a concern. We need to disrupt any potential villager coordination, and a sudden, unexpected target might do that.\n\nLet's reconsider. What if we target the person who seems the most likely to *suspect* us? It's hard to tell with so little information. I'm going to stick with my initial assessment for now, but I'm open to other ideas.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
