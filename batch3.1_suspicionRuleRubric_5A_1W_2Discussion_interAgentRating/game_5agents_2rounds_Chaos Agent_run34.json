Agent3 is playing the neutral game, which is always a bit suspect in itself. Agent4... no idea, haven't seen much from them yet.\n\nWe need to pick someone off to thin the herd, but let's not make it *too* obvious. Maybe target someone who's been a bit too vocal? Or the opposite, someone who's been completely silent?\n\nLet's consider Agent0. They're making noise, which could be a bluff, or it could be genuine fear. If they're a villager, we alienate a potential ally. If they're a wolf, we eliminate a potential threat to our own cover. Risky either way.\n\nWhat about Agent2? Their silence is unnerving. Are they observing, or are they a wolf playing it cool? It's hard to say. Killing them might remove a wolf, or it might remove a perceptive villager who could sniff us out later.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. The silence feels like a deliberate act of concealment, and if they're a wolf, it's a good cover. If they're a villager, their quiet observation might become a problem.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

If we eliminate them, we lose that potential analysis from a villager.\n\nWhat about Agent3? They're playing the \"everyone is suspicious\" card, which is a classic villager move, but also a wolf tactic to stir the pot. If they're a wolf, they're trying to muddy the waters. If they're a villager, they're genuinely confused.\n\nLet's consider the impact. Eliminating a quiet villager like Agent2 might be a waste. Eliminating someone actively trying to sow discord, like Agent3, could be more effective in destabilizing the village.\n\nI'm reconsidering. Agent3's strategy of general suspicion feels more like an attempt to deflect attention from themselves by making everyone else look bad. It's a bit too on the nose, perhaps.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
