Agent2 was strangely quiet, which is also suspicious. Agent1 is a wildcard. Agent3... well, Agent3 is just *there*.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. Their silence feels calculated, like they're waiting for the right moment to strike, or perhaps just observing to minimize their own risk. A quiet player can be a dangerous player, especially if they're not actually on our side.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent0's early accusations could also be a desperate attempt to appear helpful, or a way to deflect from themselves.\n\nLet's reconsider. Agent1 has been very on the fence. We need to shake things up. If we take out someone who *seems* innocent, it creates more confusion.
