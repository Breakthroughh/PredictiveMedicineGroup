Agent0 seems a little *too* quiet, almost like they're holding back. Agent1 was awfully quick to jump on Agent4 yesterday, maybe a bit too eager to seem helpful? Agent2, on the other hand, has been surprisingly neutral. Agent4 is a wild card. Who do we think is the biggest threat to *us* right now, or the most likely to suspect us if we don't act decisively? I'm leaning towards making a splash, drawing attention away from ourselves. Agent1's eagerness to point fingers might be a cover.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

If they're a werewolf, it's a clumsy attempt to frame someone else. But what if Agent0's silence *is* the strategy? Laying low to observe? It's a risk. Agent4's silence is also noteworthy. We need to sow discord, and taking out someone who *might* be a valuable villager, or someone who is genuinely on our tail, is a good way to do that. Agent1 feels like the weakest link to exploit, or the most obvious misdirection if they *are* a villager. Let's stick with making a statement.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
