Agent2 seemed to jump on the first suggestion without much thought, which could be naivete, or it could be a calculated move to seem innocent. Agent3 and Agent4... haven't really seen much from them yet. Honestly, I'm leaning towards Agent2. Their eagerness to conform feels like a classic villager play to deflect.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
