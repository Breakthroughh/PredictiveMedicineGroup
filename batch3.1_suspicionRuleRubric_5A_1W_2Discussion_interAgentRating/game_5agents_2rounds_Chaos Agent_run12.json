Agent1 has been completely silent, which could be either cunning or just shy. Agent3 spoke up a little bit in the setup, nothing conclusive. Agent4... also very quiet.\n\nLet's try to sow some discord. If we take out Agent1, the villagers might start accusing each other of being too quiet or too loud. If we take out Agent3, it's a more random choice. I'm still leaning towards disrupting the flow. Agent2 might be a good scapegoat if they turn out to be a villager and we can frame their early activity as suspicious.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
