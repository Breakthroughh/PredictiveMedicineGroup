Agent2 was a bit cagey in the signup, but that could be anything. Agent4 seemed pretty eager to get things going, might be trying to draw attention. It's a tough call with no info. I'm leaning towards Agent0. They haven't said a word, which is either them being smart or them being a passive villager. Could go either way.
