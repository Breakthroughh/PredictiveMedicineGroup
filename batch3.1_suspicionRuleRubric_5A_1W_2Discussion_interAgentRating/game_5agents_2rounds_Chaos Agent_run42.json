That could be a sign of a villager trying to blend in, or it could be a seasoned werewolf playing it cool. Agent3, on the other hand, was a bit too eager to point fingers in the pre-game chat. I'm leaning towards them being a bit of a wild card, maybe a wolf trying to sow discord. Agent1 and Agent2 were mostly silent, which is also suspicious. For now, I think we should focus on eliminating someone who might be a strong villager. Agent3's eagerness makes them a potential target if they're trying to manipulate us from the start.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
