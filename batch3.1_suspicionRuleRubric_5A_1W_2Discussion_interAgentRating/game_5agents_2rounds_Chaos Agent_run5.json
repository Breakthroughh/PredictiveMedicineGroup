Agent1 seemed a little too eager to get things going in the initial setup, almost like they *wanted* to be noticed. Agent4 is quiet, which could be good or bad. Agent2 and Agent3 are wild cards.\n\nMy gut says we shouldn't be too obvious on the first night. Maybe we let the villagers start pointing fingers at each other. But if we *have* to make a move, who\u2019s the most suspicious without looking like we\u2019re targeting someone we're trying to frame later?\n\nLet's go with the quiet one. Less attention paid to them means less chance they were actually trying to be strategic.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
