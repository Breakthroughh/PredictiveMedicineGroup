Agent3 was quiet, which could be smart, or it could be them observing. Agent4, well, they didn't say much either. I'm leaning towards taking out someone who might be a bit too observant, someone who could be a threat to our operations. Agent2's defensiveness felt a little\u2026 performative. What do you guys think? We don't want to create suspicion amongst ourselves by being too obvious.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

They were very quick to try and establish a narrative, which could be a sign they're trying to control the flow of information. If they're a villager, they might be trying to flush us out. If they're a wolf, they're trying to frame someone else. Let's not get tunnel vision on one person. The quiet ones can be just as dangerous. Agent3 and Agent4 haven't given us much to work with. I'm still wary of Agent2's energy, but Agent0's proactive approach feels a little too much like a setup.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
