      "content": "Alright, team. Night 1. No information yet, which is both good and bad. Good because we can shape the narrative. Bad because we don't know who's suspicious.\n\nMy initial gut feeling is to go after someone who seems too quiet, or perhaps too eager. Agent0 hasn't said a word in any of the setup, which could be strategic... or just them being quiet. Agent4 was also pretty neutral.\n\nLet's consider Agent2. They've been a bit too active in the pre-game setup, trying to establish themselves as the \"logical\" one. That kind of overt positioning can be a tell.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. It's a bold move, and if they are a villager, it might throw them off guard. If they're a werewolf, well, we just pruned our own tree, which is less ideal but still understandable on Night 1.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
