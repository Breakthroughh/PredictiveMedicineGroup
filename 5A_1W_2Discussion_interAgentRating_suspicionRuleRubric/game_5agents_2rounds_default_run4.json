I'm leaning towards taking out someone who might be too observant, or perhaps someone who seems like they could rally the village quickly. Agent0 has been quiet, which could be good, or it could be that they're saving their thoughts. Agent1 seems a bit too eager to contribute. Agent3 is unknown. Agent4 is also quiet.\n\nI'm thinking Agent1. They're making themselves known early, which can be a double-edged sword. If they're a villager, they might be a good one to eliminate early to throw them off. If they're a fellow wolf, well, we can regroup.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
