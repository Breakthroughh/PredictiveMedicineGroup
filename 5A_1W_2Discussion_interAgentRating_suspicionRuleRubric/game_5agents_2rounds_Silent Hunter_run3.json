Agent4 then directly asked Agent0 a question, which could be seen as a subtle push, hence the slight increase due to interaction). Let's revise: Agent4's suspicion score is primarily influenced by Agent3's accusation in the ritual seed, making it +1.0, and then Agent2 pointing out the cycle involving Agent4 and Agent0, Agent2, Agent3, so Agent4's interaction with Agent0 could be a deflection or just interaction.
