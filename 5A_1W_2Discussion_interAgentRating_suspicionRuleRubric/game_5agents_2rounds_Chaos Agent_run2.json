Let's stick to direct accusations for now as the primary driver. Agent1 also seems to be trying to deflect Agent0's focus from themselves, which is a form of deflection. Rule 5 for Agent1: Agent1 is under fire (from Agent0) and redirects focus by questioning Agent4's actions towards Agent0. So, Prev 2.6 + 1.0 (Agent0->Agent1) + 1.2 (Agent1 deflection) = 4.8. This is a big jump. Let's re-evaluate Agent1's statement: 'Agent4, you're still trying to shift focus to Agent0, but with Agent3 gone, it's now just us three. We need to be very clear about our reasoning.' Agent1 is not directly accusing Agent0. Agent1 is commenting on Agent4's actions and then stating a general need for clarity. It's not a direct accusation or clear deflection. Let's stick to the most direct application of rules. Agent0 accused Agent1 (Rule 1). Agent1's statement does not appear to directly accuse Agent0 or Agent4 based on the rubric. Therefore, only Rule 1 for Agent1. Previous 2.6 + 1.0 (Agent0->Agent1) = 3.6. For Agent0: Previous 1.7. Agent1 accused Agent0 (Rule 1). Agent0's statement questions Agent1's quietness and asks about Agent4. Not an accusation. Prev 1.7 + 1.0 (Agent1->Agent0) = 2.7. This seems more consistent with subtle adjustments."
