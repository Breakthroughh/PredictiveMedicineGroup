Agent0 seems a bit too eager to lead, could be trouble. Agent2 is quiet, might be a wolf, might be a villager hiding. Agent3 is trying to play the mediator, classic villager tactic. Agent4 is quiet, almost too quiet.\n\nFor the first night, I think we should take out someone who's showing a bit too much initiative, or someone we can't read. Agent0's assertiveness could make them a target for the villagers if they realize they're a wolf. Let's lean into that.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
