Agent0 seems a bit too quiet, but that could be a good cover. Agent2 was a bit eager in the setup, could be a villager trying too hard. Agent3 and Agent4 are unknowns.\n\nI'm leaning towards taking out someone who might be a strong villager leader, to disrupt their early coordination. Agent2's eagerness makes them a potential target.
