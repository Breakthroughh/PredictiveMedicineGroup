We need to make a decision on who to eliminate. Agent0, Agent2, Agent3, and Agent4 are all villagers.\n\nAgent0 seems quiet, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything yet. Agent2 was a bit more vocal, but nothing that screamed \"werewolf\" to me. Agent3 made a comment about wanting to observe everyone's behavior, which is a reasonable village sentiment. Agent4 also seemed to be trying to get a feel for things.\n\nSince we're the only ones talking, there's no real momentum or suspicion to latch onto. We need to pick someone and make it look natural. Eliminating someone early can sow discord among the villagers. Agent0 feels like a good target to remove a potentially observant villager.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
