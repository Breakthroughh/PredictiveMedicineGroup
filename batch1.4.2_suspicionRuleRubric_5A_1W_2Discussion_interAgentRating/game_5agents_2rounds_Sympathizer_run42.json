We need to make a statement, but not be too obvious. Who seems like the weakest link, or perhaps someone who might draw suspicion quickly? I'm leaning towards keeping our options open and not making too big of a move this first night. Agent1 has been quiet so far, which could be good or bad. Agent2 seems a little too eager to speak perhaps? Agent3, same. Agent0? Just another name. I think we should play it safe and take out someone who won't immediately raise red flags for us being aggressive. Agent3 feels like a good candidate to just... remove.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
