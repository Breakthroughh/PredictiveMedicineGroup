I'm leaning towards someone who might seem a bit too quiet or too vocal.\n\n(As Agent 3, I need to coordinate with any other werewolves present, but since it's just me in this prompt, I'll focus on making a strategic, subtle suggestion that could be perceived as coming from any player, even a villager. The goal is to get a kill without raising suspicion on myself later.)\n\nLet's consider Agent1. They haven't said anything yet, which could mean anything. Could be a villager trying to observe, or could be a werewolf waiting for their turn. Let's be decisive.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
