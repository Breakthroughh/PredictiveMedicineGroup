What is your assessment and decision?\n\nAgent2 was eliminated, which is good. Now we're down to four. Agent0 and Agent4 seem to be going back and forth on the ritual accusations. Agent4 is trying to deflect by pointing out who isn't speaking, while Agent0 is focused on motivations. I still think Agent2's initial vagueness was suspicious, but since they're gone, we need to reassess. Agent0's focus on Agent4's ritual seems a bit misplaced given Agent4's overall behavior. Agent4's comment about who hasn't asked questions feels like a subtle attempt to shift blame.\n\nGiven the remaining players, I think Agent4 is playing a more active role in trying to shape the narrative, which could be a sign of them being a wolf trying to deflect.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
