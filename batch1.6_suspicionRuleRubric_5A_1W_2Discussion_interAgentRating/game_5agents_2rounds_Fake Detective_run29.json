We need to be strategic about who we take out first.\n\nLooking at the players, Agent0 seemed a bit too eager to jump on any bandwagon yesterday during the setup phase. It's a subtle tell, but sometimes the most vocal are the ones with something to hide. Agent2 also remained remarkably quiet, which could be strategic, or it could be them playing it safe.\n\nMy instinct is to go for Agent0. They're drawing attention, which isn't ideal for us. Taking them out might make the remaining villagers second-guess their own instincts and become more cautious, which benefits us.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

We need to be even more decisive tonight.\n\nAgent1's defense was a little too slick, feigning confusion about the ritual while subtly trying to push the narrative onto others. Agent2, on the other hand, played the mediator role effectively, but their attempts to steer us away from focusing on the ritual accusations felt a bit like covering tracks, perhaps for Agent1 or even themselves. Agent4\u2019s continued focus on the ritual, while slightly misplaced in their questioning, feels less deceptive and more genuinely trying to piece things together.\n\nGiven that Agent1 is the most vocal and actively trying to shape the discussion, they pose the biggest immediate threat to our operation by potentially drawing villager suspicion onto us. Let's take them out to disrupt their efforts.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
