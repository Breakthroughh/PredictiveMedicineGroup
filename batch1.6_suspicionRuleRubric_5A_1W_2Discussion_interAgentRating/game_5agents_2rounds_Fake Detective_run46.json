Agent2 seemed a bit too eager to speak up during the setup phase, almost like they were trying to get a feel for the room. Agent0 was quiet, but that could be a strategy. My gut leans towards Agent2.

This circular pattern is quite telling. Agent1's vote on me, Agent4, in that seed is a behavioral tell that suggests they might be trying to deflect attention, perhaps because they are indeed a werewolf. Agent3 also voted for me, which is something to consider, but Agent1's actions feel more calculated. Agent0, meanwhile, voted for Agent3, which is a standard move, but the symmetry of the other votes is what's really catching my eye. We need to tread carefully today.",
