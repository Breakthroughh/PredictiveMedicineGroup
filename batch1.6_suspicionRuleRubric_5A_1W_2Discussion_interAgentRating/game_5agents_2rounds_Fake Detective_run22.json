Agent1 seemed a bit too eager to jump on any suspicion, almost as if they were trying to direct the attention away from themselves. Agent3's silence was also notable, but Agent0\u2019s quietness feels more strategic. I'm leaning towards Agent0 as our target. It's a solid, subtle pick.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
