We want to sow as much chaos as possible, but also eliminate a potential threat.\n\nAgent0 seemed a little *too* quiet during setup, almost like they were conserving their energy for something. Agent1, on the other hand, was a bit too eager to jump into conversation, maybe trying too hard to blend in. Agent2 felt... observant, but not in a villager-seeking way. More like they were sizing things up. Agent4 was a bit all over the place, but nothing overtly suspicious.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'm leaning towards Agent1. Their eagerness to talk feels like they might be a seer trying to gather information early. Taking them out now could disrupt any early villager strategies.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent0 has been very active, deflecting and accusing, trying to paint themselves as a concerned villager while subtly pushing the narrative against me. Agent2, on the other hand, has been more focused on asking questions and trying to piece things together, which aligns more with a villager's approach.\n\nIf we eliminate Agent2, Agent0 might become suspicious and clam up, or even focus their attention solely on me.
