We can't afford to draw too much attention to ourselves just yet.\n\nLooking at the initial lineup, Agent0 seems a bit too eager to jump into discussions, almost like they *want* to be the hero. Agent2 was remarkably quiet, which could be cunning, or just\u2026 quiet. Agent3 and Agent4, well, they haven't really shown their hand yet.\n\nMy gut tells me Agent0 is a potential problem. If they *are* a villager, their eagerness could make them a liability later. If they're a wolf, they're too obvious. Let's consider targeting them to sow confusion. Alternatively, eliminating someone less defined like Agent2 could be safer, but less impactful.\n\nI'm leaning towards making a move that sends a message but doesn't immediately scream \"werewolf.\" Let's take out Agent0. It's a bit of a gamble, but if they *are* a wolf, we get rid of one of our own, which is obviously bad. But if they're a villager, their over-enthusiasm might make them a target for the wolves anyway. Taking them out now feels like a calculated risk to put the villagers on edge.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
