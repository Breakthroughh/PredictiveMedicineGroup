I've been observing the limited information we have, and I'm leaning towards Agent4.\n\nHere's my reasoning, purely from a deduction standpoint, of course: Agent0 and Agent2 haven't said much yet, which could be anything, but Agent3 was a little *too* eager to jump into the fray in their pre-game intro, almost like they were trying to establish a presence too quickly. Agent4, however, was notably absent from any of the initial hypothetical scenarios during the intro phase. It's a subtle thing, but someone trying to lay low, perhaps someone with a hidden agenda, might do that. It's a behavioral tell. Eliminating them now could disrupt any potential plans they might have.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
