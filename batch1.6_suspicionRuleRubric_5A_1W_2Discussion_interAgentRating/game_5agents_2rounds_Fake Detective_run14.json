They might be a villager playing it safe, or they might be a wolf trying to avoid drawing attention. Agent3, on the other hand, was a little too eager to jump into speculation in the pre-game chatter. It felt... performative. I'm leaning towards Agent0 for a clean elimination, but let's hear thoughts.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
