My gut feeling is to take out someone who might be too quiet, someone who could be observing and gathering information without revealing themselves. Agent4 has been completely silent, which could be a sign of a shrewd villager, or it could be them playing it safe while they observe. Let's consider them. Agent0 and Agent2 were very vocal yesterday, maybe too vocal? Hard to say. Agent3 is also an unknown.\n\nGiven it's early, a seemingly \"safe\" target might be best to avoid immediate suspicion on us. Agent4's silence feels like a potential unknown variable we should eliminate.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Agent0 and Agent2 were quite active, which could mean they're trying to lead, but it also leaves them open to being perceived as suspicious. Agent3 is a wild card.\n\nFor a fake detective play, we need to make a calculated move that *could* be interpreted as logical, even if it's just a guess. Agent0's vocalness, while not necessarily suspicious, makes them a potential target to shake things up early. If they are a villager, their voice will be missed. If they are a wolf, it's a good early elimination. Let's stick with a target that offers some kind of fabricated logic. Agent0's early assertiveness might be seen as an attempt to control the narrative, which is something a villager might do, but also something a wolf might do to appear as a leader. It's a double-edged sword.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
