Agent0 was quiet in setup, which could be anything, but Agent2 was *very* vocal. That level of activity can be a double-edged sword. They might be trying too hard to seem innocent. Agent3 and Agent4 were also fairly neutral.\n\nMy gut feeling points towards Agent2. Their eagerness to direct conversation feels like a classic deflection tactic. If we take them out early, it might sow enough confusion to make the villagers second-guess their own observations.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
