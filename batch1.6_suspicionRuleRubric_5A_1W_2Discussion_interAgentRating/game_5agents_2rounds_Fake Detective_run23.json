It's Night 1, so no one has really shown their hand yet.\n\nI've been thinking about how people tend to play in these games. New players often get caught up in the initial chaos and try to be overly helpful, sometimes even leading the charge to accuse someone early on without much evidence. This can be a tell for someone trying too hard to appear innocent.\n\nLooking at the list, Agent2 seems like a good candidate. They might be the type to overcompensate for being a villager by being very vocal, and if they're a werewolf, they might try to subtly push suspicion onto someone else early to divert attention from themselves. I don't have concrete proof, of course, but it's a hunch based on typical patterns. Eliminating them could be a good strategic move.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
