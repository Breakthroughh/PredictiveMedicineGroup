It's a classic avoidance tactic. Agent1, on the other hand, was a bit too eager to jump into potential lynches yesterday. They\u2019re trying too hard to appear like a concerned villager, but it smells off. Agent2 and Agent3 haven't given us much to work with yet.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards Agent1. Their over-eagerness feels like a desperate attempt to misdirect. We can frame it as them trying to railroad someone early to create chaos.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Their previous eagerness to push for lynches, combined with their lack of substantial input in our brief private discussion, makes them a perfect scapegoat. We can argue that they were *too* active, trying to control the narrative from the start. It's a pattern of behavior that screams \"trying too hard.\" Agent0's silence is also suspicious, but Agent1's proactive-but-flawed behavior is easier to weaponize publicly.
