We need to make a move that seems natural but also eliminates a threat.\n\nLooking at the limited information we have (which is none, really, but we have to pretend), the safest bet is to go after someone who might be a wildcard. Agent0 has been quiet, almost *too* quiet. That kind of stillness can be a calculated move by a villager trying to stay under the radar, or it could be a sign of a lurking werewolf playing it safe. I'm leaning towards it being the latter. If they're playing it safe, they're likely a villager who's already suspicious of someone else. Removing them creates a bit of chaos and shifts focus.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
