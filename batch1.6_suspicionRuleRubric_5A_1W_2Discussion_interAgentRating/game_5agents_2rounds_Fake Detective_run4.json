We need to make a move that looks like a villager trying to identify a threat, but also doesn't raise too much suspicion on us.\n\nAgent0 seemed a bit too eager to jump on Agent1 during setup, though there wasn't much to go on. Agent3 was quiet, almost suspiciously so. Agent4 is a complete unknown. Agent2... well, Agent2 is me.\n\nLet's consider who would be the most impactful early kill from the villagers' perspective. If we take out a potential investigator, it might sow confusion. Agent0's eagerness could be a misdirection, or it could be genuine confusion. Agent3's silence could be strategic, or it could be a lack of information.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. Their immediate reactivity, while not conclusive, is the only real data point we have to work with from the setup. If they *are* a villager, it's a relatively low-cost elimination to remove someone who might be a noisy early voter. If they're a wolf, well, then we've identified one of our own, which isn't ideal but manageable. It\u2019s a calculated risk.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Their immediate jump to Agent1 in the initial setup feels like an attempt to create a narrative, perhaps to draw out other opinions or to establish themselves as an active player. It's a subtle tell, but it's the only real data point we have from the initial moments. If they're a villager, we remove a potentially vocal element.
