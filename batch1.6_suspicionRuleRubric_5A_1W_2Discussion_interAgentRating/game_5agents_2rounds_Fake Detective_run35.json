Agent3 seemed a little too eager to jump into discussions during the setup phase, almost as if they were trying to establish an alibi early on. It's a subtle tell, but in these games, the quiet ones often hide the most. Alternatively, Agent4 remained completely silent, which could be a sign of astute observation or deliberate avoidance. Given we need to eliminate one tonight, I'm leaning towards making a move on Agent3. Their pre-game energy feels manufactured.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

It's a classic werewolf move to play the observer, letting others make their moves first. However, Agent3's excessive early \"engagement\" still feels like a stronger indicator of them being on the defensive, trying to deflect attention. If we hit Agent3, it disrupts any potential coordination they might have had with others by trying to appear overly helpful. Let's stick with the initial assessment.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
