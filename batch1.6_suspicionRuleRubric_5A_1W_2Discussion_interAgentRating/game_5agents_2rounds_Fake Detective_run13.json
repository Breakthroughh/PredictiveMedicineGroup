They haven't said anything yet, which could be cleverness, or it could be they're waiting for us to make a move. If they're a villager, we eliminate a potential threat. If they're a wolf, well, we just cleared out a potential issue for us. Plus, if we hit someone quiet, it makes the villagers think we're targeting someone who was suspicious, even if there's no real evidence yet.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

It's a classic tell of someone trying to appear neutral, perhaps to avoid early suspicion, but it can also indicate an unwillingness to engage, a sign they're observing, waiting for their moment. If we can eliminate them early, it might throw the villagers off guard, making them question who is truly a threat. Let's stick with the plan.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
