We need to be strategic.\n\nConsidering what we know, or rather, what we *don't* know yet, it's probably best to remove someone who might be a bit too observant or could be a threat later. Agent4 seemed a little too quiet in the pre-game setup, almost like they were assessing the landscape. Or perhaps Agent2, they had a strange reaction to the initial setup, a slight hesitation.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. It's a gut feeling, but those hesitations can often hide something. They're a known entity, we can play off them later. Let's strike now.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent0 seemed to be trying to gather information very early on, which could be a villager trait, or a very cunning werewolf trying to establish a baseline. Agent3 was also quite passive, which is always a bit suspect.\n\nHowever, if we're going for someone who might be a bit too eager to control the narrative, Agent0 could be a target. They might try to lead the pack early. It's a delicate balance, but taking out someone who could become an early leader for the villagers is often a good move.\n\nLet's reconsider Agent0. They were quick to jump in with observations, which could be a sign of a powerful villager role trying to establish credibility, or someone trying to steer the conversation away from themselves. Removing them early would disrupt any emerging villager strategy.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

It shows a lot of internal suspicion already.\n\nBased on this early pattern, Agent3's vote against Agent2 feels particularly pointed, especially since Agent2 then voted for Agent4. It suggests Agent3 might be trying to deflect attention by going after someone else. Agent4's vote for me is also something to consider \u2013 a bit bold for someone trying to lay low.\n\nWe need to be careful about who is trying to lead or control the narrative too early.\n\nMy focus is on Agent3.
