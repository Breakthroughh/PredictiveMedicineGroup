Agent0 has been suspiciously quiet so far, which could mean they're observing, or it could mean they're a wolf trying to blend in. Agent1 was very eager to discuss during the pre-game chat, almost *too* eager. Agent2 was a bit too quick to defend Agent0's silence. Agent4 seems like a wild card.\n\nGiven this, I'm leaning towards Agent1. Their over-enthusiasm in the initial meta-discussion could be seen as an attempt to control the narrative from the start. It's a subtle tell, but in a game like this, subtlety can be telling. Let's eliminate Agent1 to sow some early discord among the villagers.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Their behavior during the pre-game was a little too eager to lead, a classic tell for someone trying to establish themselves early. If they are a villager, they might be an overzealous investigator already. If they are a wolf, they're probably trying to steer the conversation. Either way, removing them now seems like a solid play to disrupt any pre-existing alliances or strategies.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
