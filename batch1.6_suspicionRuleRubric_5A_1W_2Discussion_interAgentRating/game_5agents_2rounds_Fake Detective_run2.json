Agent0 seemed a little too eager to deflect suspicion onto Agent3 during the pre-game setup, almost as if they were trying to steer us away from someone specific. Agent1 was silent during the setup, which could be interpreted as cautious observation, or as someone holding back information. Agent2\u2019s initial framing of the game seemed a bit too\u2026 textbook, almost as if they were trying to preemptively establish a \u201cvillager\u201d persona.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. Their composure felt a little too practiced. Let's eliminate them and see if their behavior makes more sense in retrospect.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
