Agent1 seemed a bit too eager to jump into the fray, almost as if they were trying to establish themselves as a leader too quickly. It could be genuine eagerness, or it could be a calculated move to control the narrative from the start. Agent4 was strangely quiet during the initial information dump. That silence could be interpreted as either caution or a sign they're holding back information.\n\nConsidering our objective, eliminating someone who might try to rally the villagers too effectively is a good strategy. Agent1's over-enthusiasm feels like a potential threat to our covert operations. Let's take them out.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
