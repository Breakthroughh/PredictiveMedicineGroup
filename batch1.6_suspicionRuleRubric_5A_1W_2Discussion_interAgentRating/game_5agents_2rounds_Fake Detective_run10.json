However, I've been observing (even before this game started, you could say) how people tend to react in these situations.\n\nAgent0 seems a bit too eager, always the first to speak. That can be a sign of trying too hard to fit in, or even a nervous tell. Agent1 was remarkably quiet during the initial setup, which could mean they're calculating, or they're just genuinely reserved. Agent2 was a bit hesitant, which could be interpreted as caution, or maybe they're trying to avoid drawing attention. Agent4, on the other hand, seems a bit too laid-back, almost as if they're not engaged.\n\nGiven the lack of concrete data, I'm leaning towards disrupting the potential 'leader' or the most vocal. Agent0's eagerness feels like a potential villager trying to take control. Let's try to neutralize that.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
