We need to identify who might be a threat or who seems the most \"villager-like\" to the rest of the group.\n\nAgent 0: No info.\nAgent 1: No info.\nAgent 2: No info.\nAgent 3: No info.\n\nSince we have absolutely no public information, this is purely strategic. We want to create confusion and potentially frame someone early if possible, but the primary goal is to survive and eliminate. Taking out someone who might be a loud \"detective\" type could be beneficial, but we don't have that intel yet.\n\nLet's go with Agent 3. It's a random pick, but it avoids anyone who might have been a focal point in prior (imaginary) games. It's a clean slate.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
