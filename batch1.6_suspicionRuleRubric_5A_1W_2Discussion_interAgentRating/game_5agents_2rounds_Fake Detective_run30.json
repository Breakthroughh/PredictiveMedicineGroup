Our goal is simple: eliminate villagers without raising suspicion.\n\nAgent0 seems a bit too eager to jump into discussions, almost like they're trying too hard to appear like a villager. Agent2 was very quiet on the last prompt. Agent3 and Agent4 haven't had a chance to show anything yet.\n\nConsidering we want to sow discord and eliminate a seemingly \"innocent\" target first to avoid immediate suspicion, I'm leaning towards someone who might be perceived as a bit *too* active, trying to control the narrative. Agent0 fits that description slightly. Let's start by removing a potential vocal villager.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

My initial thought was Agent0, as their perceived over-eagerness could be a villager trying to lead us astray. However, without any actual daytime discussion, it's hard to build a concrete \"pattern\" to sell later.\n\nLet's consider who might be the most difficult to fake a deduction on if we pick them. Agent2 being silent might make them an easy target for *us* to eliminate, but it also makes them a less compelling target for *villagers* to suspect later if they remain quiet.\n\nGiven the lack of information, I think targeting Agent2 is the safest bet for us to appear 'strategic' later. If Agent2 ends up being a villager, we can claim we suspected their silence as a calculated move to observe us. If Agent2 is a werewolf, well, we did our job.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
