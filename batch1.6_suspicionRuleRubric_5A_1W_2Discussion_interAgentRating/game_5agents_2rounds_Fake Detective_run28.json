My gut tells me we should go after the loudest voices first. It can sow discord and make the villagers distrust each other.\n\nAgent0 seemed a bit too eager to get into discussions last game, if I recall. Agent1 was quiet, almost too quiet. Agent2 was a moderate presence. Agent3... I'm not sure I've seen Agent3 before, or at least they weren't very memorable.\n\nLet's consider Agent0. Their initial \"eagerness\" could be seen as overcompensating. If we take them out, we can later spin it as removing a potential disruptor who was maybe trying too hard to seem innocent.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

If they are a villager, that's good. If they're a wolf, they're playing it cool. However, taking out Agent0 removes a potential leader of the villager faction early on, which is a strong move. It will force the others to step up, and we can then analyze their reactions. My previous assessment holds.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
