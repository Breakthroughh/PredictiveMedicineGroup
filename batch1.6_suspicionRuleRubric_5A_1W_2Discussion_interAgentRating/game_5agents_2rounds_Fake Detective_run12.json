Agent3 was uncharacteristically quiet in the initial setup, almost too quiet. It feels like a deliberate attempt to avoid drawing attention, which is a classic tell for someone trying to conceal their true role. Agent1, on the other hand, seems a bit too eager to please, which can also be a tactic. But Agent3's silence feels more... calculated. We want to sow chaos and fear, and taking out someone who might be a quiet leader or a potential investigator would be a good start.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

If they're a villager, they're trying to avoid notice, which is fine. But if they're a werewolf, that same silence is their shield. I still think targeting them creates the most uncertainty and disrupts any potential village cohesion. Agent1's eagerness is a bit of a red herring, a common villager tactic to appear active.

Then, in their statement, they feigned a neutral position, asking for \"actual thoughts.\" This dual approach \u2013 attacking first and then playing innocent \u2013 is a sophisticated play. Agent2, while your statements are somewhat neutral, you seem to be observing and processing, which is what a villager might do. Agent4 is just... there.
