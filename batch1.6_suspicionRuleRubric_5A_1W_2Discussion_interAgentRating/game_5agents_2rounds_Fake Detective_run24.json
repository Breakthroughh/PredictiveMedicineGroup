We need to eliminate one of the villagers to start thinning the herd.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent3. I was observing their reactions during the very brief prelude to the game \u2013 a subtle flinch when roles were announced. It\u2019s a minor tell, but those are the kind of things I\u2019m trained to spot. It suggests a nervousness that might be indicative of something more than just the usual player jitters. Alternatively, Agent1 seemed a bit too eager to deflect any potential scrutiny, which can also be a sign of someone hiding something. However, the twitch from Agent3 feels more like an instinctual reaction to exposure. Let\u2019s take out Agent3.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Someone trying too hard to appear neutral often betrays their hidden agenda with a split-second involuntary movement. Agent1 is a close second, but the perceived nervousness of Agent3 feels more like a direct response to role assignments, which could mean they know they\u2019re a target or are trying to mask their own identity.
