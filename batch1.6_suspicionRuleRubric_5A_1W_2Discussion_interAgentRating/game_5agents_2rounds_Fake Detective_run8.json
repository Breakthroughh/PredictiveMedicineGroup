Who's looking the most suspicious to the villagers, or who would be the biggest loss to them if they were gone? Agent0 has been very quiet, almost *too* quiet. That could be them playing it safe, or it could be them waiting to see how things shake out before revealing their hand. I'm leaning towards taking them out to sow some immediate confusion.

Agent2 has been surprisingly vocal in the past, and if they're playing a more active villager role, removing them could disrupt their efforts to rally the village. Agent3 is also a bit of an unknown. Given we only have one night, a more established presence might be a better target. Agent4 seems like a wildcard. I'm still leaning towards Agent0 because their silence is a strong behavioral tell for someone trying to avoid detection early on. It's a classic werewolf move to go after the quiet ones.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
