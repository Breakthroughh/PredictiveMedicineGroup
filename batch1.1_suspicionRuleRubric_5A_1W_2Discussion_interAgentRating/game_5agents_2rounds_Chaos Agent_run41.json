Or, more importantly, who is most likely to *appear* like a threat and draw attention away from us?\n\nAgent0 has been quiet so far, which could be good or bad. Agent1... also quiet. Agent3 and Agent4 were the ones who spoke up the most during the initial setup, so they might be the most vocal on the first day. Drawing attention to one of them seems like a solid play. But then again, if they're *too* obvious, the villagers might see right through it.\n\nWhat if we pick someone who seems innocent? Someone who might be a seer or a doctor? That would be a devastating blow to them. Agent4 seemed a bit too eager to explain things, almost like they were trying to establish a persona. Let's go with that.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

It feels like they're trying to project confidence, which can sometimes be a tell. But on the flip side, someone *too* quiet might be trying to hide something too. Agent0, for example. Could they be a quiet killer?\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong gut feeling about anyone else. Agent3 and Agent1 were fairly neutral. If we want to sow maximum discord on Day 1, picking someone who *isn't* obviously vocal might be a good move.\n\nLet's stick with the initial thought. Agent4 feels like a good target to disrupt the early game.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Agent3 is the most active, which could make them a target for the villagers, or they could be a cunning villager themselves.\n\nGiven that no one was eliminated, we need to pick someone off who can't contribute to a unified villager front.

Agent3 is the most vocal, which might make them a target for the villagers, but they're also the most active in trying to figure things out.\n\nIf we eliminate Agent0, it removes a potentially dangerous silent threat and hopefully makes the villagers focus on the more vocal players like Agent3, which would be ideal for us.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
