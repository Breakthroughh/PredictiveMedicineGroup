Agent1 was a little quiet during the initial setup, which could be nothing, or it could be them playing it safe. Agent2 was a bit too eager, asking a lot of questions. Classic villager trying to gather info, or a werewolf trying to steer the conversation? Hard to say this early. Agent3 and Agent4 are just... there. No real tells. I'm leaning towards taking out someone who might be a bit too observant, or someone who's trying too hard to be innocent. Agent2's eagerness feels a little suspect.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
