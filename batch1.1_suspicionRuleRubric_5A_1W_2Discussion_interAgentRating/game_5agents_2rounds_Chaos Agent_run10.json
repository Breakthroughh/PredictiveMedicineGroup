Agent1 was a bit too eager to get things started on the discord server, which feels like a classic werewolf tactic to draw attention. Agent2, on the other hand, seemed genuinely confused by the game mechanics, which is a good cover. Agent4\u2026 honestly, I\u2019m not sure yet. Let\u2019s not get too predictable. If we go for Agent0, it might look too obvious. Agent1 is a good candidate, but maybe too obvious. I think Agent2 is the best bet.
