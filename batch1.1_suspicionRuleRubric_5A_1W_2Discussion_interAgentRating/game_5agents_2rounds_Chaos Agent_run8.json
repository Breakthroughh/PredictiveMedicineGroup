Agent2 was also a bit too eager to jump on any suspicion yesterday, which is a classic tell. Agent3, on the other hand, seemed a bit lost in the shuffle, could be a good cover. Agent4... still a bit of an unknown.\n\nMy gut feeling is leaning towards Agent2. Their over-enthusiasm feels like a desperate attempt to appear helpful.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

What if Agent2's eagerness is actually a sign of genuine confusion, not deception? We don't want to eliminate an innocent too early and tip our hand.\n\nAgent0's silence is still a bit suspicious to me, but maybe it's just strategic observation. Agent3 is a complete wildcard.\n\nLet's consider a different approach. If we take out Agent0, it might create a bigger stir and put the villagers on edge, making them more prone to making mistakes in the next day phase.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
