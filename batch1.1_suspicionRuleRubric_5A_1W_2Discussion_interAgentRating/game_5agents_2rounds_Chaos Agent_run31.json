Agent1, on the other hand, is practically *begging* for attention, might be a ploy. Agent2's been a wildcard in the past, could be anything. And Agent3? Too eager to please, which is always a red flag. We need to make them nervous from the start. Who do we think is the weakest link, the one they'd suspect first if things go south?\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
