No one's been eliminated yet, so we have a full house: Agent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent3, Agent4.\n\nMy initial read is a bit all over the place. Agent0 seemed a little too eager to get things rolling yesterday. A classic sign of someone trying too hard to establish themselves. But then, Agent3 was awfully quiet. That could be a calculated move, playing the innocent card, or they could be genuinely observing.\n\nAgent2, on the other hand, was a bit too quick to dismiss Agent4\u2019s initial thoughts. Almost defensively so. Makes me wonder if they have something to hide.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess right now. We need to make a move, but who? Killing Agent2 might shake things up, force someone else to step up and reveal their true colors. Alternatively, Agent0\u2019s over-eagerness could be a trap.\n\nLet's go with Agent2. Disrupting their assumed calm might be our best bet.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent0, Agent1 (myself), Agent2, Agent3, Agent4.\n\nMy previous thought about Agent2 felt a bit\u2026 premature. Maybe I overreacted to their dismissal of Agent4. Sometimes people are just direct.\n\nWhat if Agent0's eagerness was actually a sign of a strong villager trying to control the narrative early? Or perhaps Agent3's silence is the real tell. A calculated observer, waiting for the perfect moment to strike with a well-placed accusation.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to tell with just one round of private chat. We need to make a decisive move, but one that doesn't immediately point fingers at us.\n\nLet's consider Agent0. They were very vocal. If they're a villager, they might be a leader. Taking out a potential leader could sow confusion among the villagers. If they're a wolf, well, that\u2019s just good strategy.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
