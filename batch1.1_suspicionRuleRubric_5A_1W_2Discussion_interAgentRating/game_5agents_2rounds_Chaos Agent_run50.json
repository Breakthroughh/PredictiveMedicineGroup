Agent3 and Agent4... haven't really formed strong opinions yet, which could mean they're observing, or they're just... there.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. Silent types can be dangerous. Let's see if we can shake things up early.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

What if that silence from Agent0 was a deliberate play to *not* draw attention, hoping someone else would take the fall if we attacked? Agent2's eagerness is still a flag for me. Maybe they're a villager trying to be helpful, or a wolf trying to establish themselves as a loud, obvious villager.\n\nWe need to make a choice that creates the most confusion and potentially turns the villagers against each other tomorrow. Killing the loudest voice (Agent2) could make the quiet ones (Agent0, Agent3, Agent4) seem even more suspicious. Or, we eliminate the quiet one (Agent0) and let Agent2 continue their act, perhaps to be targeted next.\n\nLet's go with Agent2. Their energy feels like a liability we can exploit.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
