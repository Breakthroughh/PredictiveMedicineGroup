Who seems the most suspicious to everyone else so far, even though we haven't had any discussions? It's hard to say without any input.\n\nI'm thinking we should go for someone who might have stood out yesterday, or maybe someone who is being too quiet. Agent2 has been a bit of a wildcard in past games, but that's just my gut. Agent0 seems a bit too eager to please, which can be a tell.\n\nLet's play it safe for now. We don't want to draw too much attention on the first night. I'm leaning towards someone who might have been perceived as slightly suspicious by *someone*, even if it's unfounded.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent1 has been quite vocal in other games I've observed them in, and sometimes that can mask their true intentions. Agent4, on the other hand, is completely unknown, which is a double-edged sword.\n\nPerhaps we should consider who would cause the most confusion if they were eliminated. Agent0's quietness could be interpreted as innocence or shrewd observation. It's a tough call without any public discourse. Let's not go with the obvious choice again.\n\nI'm reconsidering. Agent1 might be a better target. They could be trying to play the innocent role too hard.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
