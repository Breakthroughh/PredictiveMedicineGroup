That means even if someone gets two votes, they're safe unless we can swing one more.\n\nMy initial read on the chat, assuming we've all seen it, is that Agent0 was a bit too eager to jump on Agent2. Could be genuine suspicion, could be a play to deflect. Agent1 was quiet, which is always a bit of an unknown. Agent3 seemed to be trying to mediate, but also didn't offer much concrete.\n\nWe need to make a decisive move. Who's the biggest threat to us, or who can we frame as a threat to them? Agent0's aggressive stance makes them a good target to eliminate *and* pin on someone else. Or we could go for someone who's been too quiet.\n\nLet's not overthink this. Agent0 is making noise, and we can use that noise against them. They're either a super-villager or a werewolf trying to be too obvious. Either way, they're a liability.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent0 was really going after them, which could mean Agent0 is a villager trying to root out a werewolf. BUT, it could also mean Agent0 is a werewolf trying to get rid of a potential threat, or even a villager trying to appear like a villager. It's all very muddy.\n\nWhat if we target Agent2? If Agent0 is indeed a villager, they'll likely be upset we didn't vote for Agent0. If Agent0 *is* a werewolf, then we've just removed a player *without* making Agent0 look like the sole killer. That might buy us some goodwill if Agent0 doesn't get voted out next.\n\nAgent1 and Agent3 are still blanks. We don't have enough info to make them primary targets. Agent0's overt actions make them a focal point, but Agent2 is the quiet one who might be hiding something significant.\n\nLet's go with Agent2. It's less predictable, and if Agent0 was trying to manipulate us, this might throw them off.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
