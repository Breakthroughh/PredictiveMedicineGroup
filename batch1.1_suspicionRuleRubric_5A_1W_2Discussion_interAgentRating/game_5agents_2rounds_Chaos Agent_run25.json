Agent2, on the other hand, seemed a little *too* eager to get discussions going. Could be a wolf trying to control the narrative, or just a nervous villager.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. They're putting themselves out there, which could be a deliberate play to draw attention away from themselves, or to manipulate the vote. What are your thoughts?

It's that lack of definitive tells that makes me nervous.\n\nHonestly, I'm still sticking with Agent2.
