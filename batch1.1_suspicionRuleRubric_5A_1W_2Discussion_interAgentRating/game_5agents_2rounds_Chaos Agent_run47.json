Agent2, on the other hand, seemed a little too eager to point fingers from the get-go. Could be a good cover, could be genuine fear. Agent4 was oddly passive, which is also suspicious. Agent1... well, Agent1 is always a wildcard.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. They're trying too hard to control the narrative, I think. If we can take out someone who's actively trying to lead the villagers astray, it\u2019ll sow more confusion.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
