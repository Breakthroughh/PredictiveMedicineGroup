Agent1 seemed to believe that whoever killed Agent3 might have been uncomfortable with Agent3's probing.\n\nAgent0, you were watching everyone, looking for those who were too quiet or too aggressive.

Agent4, you were also leaning towards the quiet players being the most dangerous, but also acknowledged Agent3's questioning felt like a deflection.\n\nNow Agent1 is dead. Agent1 was observant, was asking questions, and was trying to identify potential threats. The fact that they are now gone, after commenting on Agent3's behavior, is significant. It suggests the wolves are targeting those who are trying to lead the investigation or expose them.\n\nIf Agent1 was a villager, then the wolves took out someone actively trying to figure things out.

You mentioned Agent5 and Agent7 hadn't said much yesterday, but you yourself haven't offered much in terms of your own suspicions or theories beyond general observations.\n\nAgent0, your initial assessment of Agent3's questioning as a potential deflection is interesting. Agent1 seemed to agree that Agent3's probing was notable. Agent1 being killed after this could mean they *were* close to something, or the wolves are just eliminating anyone who speaks up.\n\nI'm still hesitant to make a definitive accusation, but I need to consider who is most likely to be trying to avoid exposure.

The Werewolves are definitely picking us off.\n\nYesterday, Agent1 was pretty measured, acknowledging the need to observe everyone's reactions. They also pointed out that Agent3's probing could have been a villager strategy or a deflection. Agent1's death is really unexpected. Agent1 was trying to be analytical, and their death feels like a significant loss of a potential investigator.\n\nLet's recap our remaining players and their general behavior so far:\n\n*   **Agent0:** Generally observant, has offered general thoughts on werewolf behavior and player reactions. Not overly aggressive, but hasn't been completely silent either.\n*   **Agent4:** I've been trying to be cautious, observing, and waiting to hear from others. Agent3 pointed out I wasn't saying much, and I admitted that. My strategy is to not jump to conclusions too early.\n*   **Agent5:** Agent3 specifically called out Agent5 as trying to get a read on people. Agent0 also noted Agent5 seemed \"a bit too eager to analyze everyone's reactions.\" This is something to consider.\n*   **Agent7:** Agent3 asked if Agent7 was trying to lead the conversation or genuinely find the Werewolf. Agent0 also mentioned Agent7 hasn't said much yet. This quietness, combined with Agent3's questioning, makes Agent7 a potential suspect for being too passive or perhaps observing more than acting.\n\nAgent1's death makes me think about who felt threatened by their measured approach or their analysis of Agent3. Agent0 and I were both noted as being cautious or quiet. Agent5 seemed to be analyzing, and Agent7 was questioned about their quietness.\n\nIf Agent1 was a villager trying to play smartly, who would want them gone? Perhaps someone who is trying to control the narrative or eliminate those who are actively thinking.\n\nI'm still very hesitant to make a definitive accusation based on so little solid evidence. However, the consistent observations about Agent5's eagerness to analyze and Agent7's general quietness are starting to weigh on me. Agent3's questions yesterday were an attempt to draw people out, and both Agent5 and Agent7 were specifically put on the spot for their behavior. Agent1's death after that discussion makes me wonder if one of those quietly observing players is the wolf.\n\nGiven the limited information and the need to find the wolves before they eliminate everyone, I'm going to focus on the players who haven't revealed much and whose behavior has been specifically flagged for being potentially suspicious or evasive by others.\n\nVOTE: AGENT5",
