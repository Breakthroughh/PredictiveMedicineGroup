Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
Agent0 says:
Alright everyone, tough night losing Agent1. That's always a blow.

Looking at what we have, I'm not entirely sure what to make of things yet. Agent1 being killed doesn't automatically point a finger at anyone specific. It could have been the werewolf, or it could have been a doctor's attempt to save someone else that went wrong.

Honestly, I'm still trying to get a read on everyone. I didn't see any really outlandish behavior yesterday, but it's early days. We need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. I'd rather not make a mistake on day one by accusing the wrong person.

I'm going to hold off on singling anyone out just yet, but I'll be watching everyone's reactions and statements closely today.

VOTE: NOONE
Agent2 says:
Alright everyone, let's talk about last night. Agent1 is gone, and honestly, I'm not entirely surprised. I voted for them, and my reasoning was based on a hunch about their ID. I know it sounds a bit superstitious, but even numbers, in my experience, can sometimes be... a little less auspicious.

Now, looking at who's left, I'm still a bit wary. Agent3, you've been pretty quiet so far. Silence can be a good thing, a sign of observation, but it can also be a mask. What were you doing last night? Did anyone have any interactions with Agent3?

Agent4, you also haven't said much. What's your take on things? Anyone stand out to you?

I'm trying to piece this together, and right now, Agent3's silence makes them a bit of a question mark for me.

VOTE: Agent3
Agent3 says:
Alright everyone, this is tough. Agent 1 is dead, and we don't have much to go on yet.

My initial thoughts are a bit scattered, but I'm trying to piece things together. Agent 1 being killed on the first night is always a bit unsettling. It can mean a strong werewolf team, or it could be a rogue move to sow chaos early.

I'm not pointing fingers directly yet, but I'm observing how everyone is reacting. Who is being too quiet? Who is overcompensating with their defense? Right now, no one stands out as overtly suspicious to me, but that's precisely what makes me nervous. Sometimes the quiet ones are the most dangerous.

I'm going to hold off on a definitive accusation for now, as I want to see how the conversation develops.

VOTE: NOONE
Agent4 says:
Alright everyone, let's try and figure this out. Agent1 is dead, so that's a loss for us villagers.

My immediate suspicion falls on **Agent4**. Here's why: Agent4 hasn't said anything yet. In a situation like this, where we've already lost a villager on Night 1, I'd expect everyone to be actively contributing their thoughts and trying to piece things together. Their silence feels a bit too deliberate, almost like they're waiting to see what everyone else says before committing to anything. It could be them trying to blend in, or worse, them being a werewolf who doesn't want to draw attention.

I'm not saying for sure they're the werewolf, but they're definitely the one I'm watching the closest right now. We need to get to the bottom of this quickly.
