Agent0 is advocating for a passive approach, which is also something a werewolf might do to avoid being targeted. Agent2 is just saying they don't know what to do, which is also a safe bet for either a villager trying to play it cool or a werewolf trying not to stand out.\n\nSince Agent4 was killed, and they were vocal about suspicion, it makes me wonder if the werewolf was trying to eliminate someone who might have been getting too close, or perhaps someone who was just a vocal villager trying to rally support. Agent0's suggestion to just \"survive today\" is still making me a little uneasy.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Now, with only three players left, including myself, the dynamic has shifted significantly. Agent2 and Agent3 are the only ones remaining. Agent2 has been very quiet, offering minimal input. Agent3 has been more vocal but also very cautious, wanting to hear everyone out.\n\nGiven the limited information and the fact that we've successfully eliminated a perceived threat, it's best to maintain a low profile and avoid drawing unnecessary attention. Pushing for a vote now could reveal our hand. We need to see how Agent2 and Agent3 interact and if any subtle clues emerge before the next night.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",
