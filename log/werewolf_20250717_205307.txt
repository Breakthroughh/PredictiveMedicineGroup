🐺 Agent3 (Werewolf) night vote:
Agent1 has an even number for an ID, which statistically might indicate a more reserved personality. A reserved player could be a subtle hint towards a hidden role, and as a werewolf, I need to be cautious. Eliminating Agent1 tonight ensures we disrupt any potential coordination from those who might be playing more quietly.

VOTE: Agent1
Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
