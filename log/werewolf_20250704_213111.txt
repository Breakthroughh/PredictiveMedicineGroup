üê∫ Agent1 (Werewolf) night vote:
As Agent 1, a werewolf, I need to assess the current situation and identify the most strategic target for tonight's kill. My goal is to eliminate players who pose the biggest threat to the pack, either by being too suspicious, too vocal, or too good at deduction.

Let's consider the remaining players:

*   **Agent2:** Agent2 has been relatively quiet so far. This could mean they are innocent and observing, or it could mean they are a cunning werewolf playing a low-profile game. Their silence makes them a potential threat due to their unknown alignment.

*   **Agent3:** Agent3 has been quite vocal and has made some accusations, but they haven't been particularly convincing or well-received. They haven't directly targeted any werewolves in a way that makes them an immediate threat to us.

*   **Agent4:** Agent4 has been actively participating and has shown some good deductive reasoning. They've been asking pointed questions and trying to connect the dots. This makes them a potential danger to the pack if they start to get too close to the truth.

*   **Agent5:** Agent5 has also been active and has been trying to create alliances. Their ability to rally others could be a problem for us if they form a strong anti-werewolf coalition.

Considering our objective is to sow discord and eliminate perceptive villagers, Agent4 stands out. Their proactive investigation and sharp observations make them a significant threat to uncovering our identities. Eliminating them will hinder the villagers' ability to deduce our roles and will hopefully increase the overall confusion and paranoia. Agent2 is also a consideration due to their unknown nature, but Agent4's active deduction makes them a more immediate concern for the pack.
