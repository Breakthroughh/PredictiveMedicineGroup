Since that didn't result in an elimination and everyone else voted NOONE, it makes sense to try and align with the perceived cautiousness of the group. Agent2 is asking questions, which could be a good sign or a deceptive one. Agent3 is focusing on deflection and suspicion, which is also typical. Agent4 is being quiet. To maintain my cover, and since no one has provided any strong leads, I'll again try to make a seemingly logical, but ultimately random, accusation to keep the \"villager\" persona. Agent2's questions, while seemingly standard, could also be a tactic to gather information without revealing much. I'll target Agent2.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

That suggests the werewolf might be targeting those who are actively trying to investigate or contribute to finding them. Agent3 voted NOONE, which keeps them in a more neutral position for now. Agent4 also voted NOONE, playing it safe. My previous vote for Agent2 was an attempt to misdirect, but it failed to get a majority. Now we are down to three: Agent1 (myself), Agent3, and Agent4. If I'm a werewolf, one of the remaining two is likely my fellow werewolf. We need to eliminate one more person to win. Agent3 is still playing it cautious with the NOONE vote. Agent4 is also quiet. Given that the werewolf killed Agent2, who was trying to get information, perhaps the werewolf is trying to eliminate active players. Agent3's early NOONE vote could be interpreted as either genuine caution or a way to avoid suspicion. Agent4's silence is also a point of consideration. I need to pick a target that either removes a potential threat or makes it look like I'm genuinely trying to find the werewolf. Agent3's strategy of observing and looking for deflection might be a genuine villager trait, or it could be a werewolf trying to set up a narrative. I think it's best to eliminate Agent3 to try and force a reaction from Agent4 and to eliminate someone who is vocal about their strategy.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
