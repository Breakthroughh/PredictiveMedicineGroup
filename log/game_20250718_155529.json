Agent4 is suspicious of those who haven't spoken much, which is a bit of a meta-commentary on my own previous silence. Agent2 is still waiting for more information, which is a reasonable approach. Since Agent1 was voted out, and we have two 'NOONE' votes from Agent2 and myself, it implies that Agent4's vote for Agent1 might have been the deciding factor, or at least a significant push. Agent4 is now the one trying to prompt others and is making observations about silence. Given that, I think it might be best to try and eliminate Agent4. They seem to be actively trying to guide the conversation and identify potential threats, which could be a good strategy for a villager, but also a good way for a werewolf to draw attention away from themselves.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
