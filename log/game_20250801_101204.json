Agent3 voted NOONE.\nNight 2: Agent2 died.\nDay 2: Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent3 voted for Agent0. Agent4 voted NOONE.\nNight 3: Agent3 died.\n\nAgent0's argument on Day 2 was that Agent2 was targeting them, and the werewolves eliminating Agent2 meant they were removing a vocal player or someone leading an investigation. This is a bit of a stretch, as Agent2 was also killed by the werewolves. Agent0 also said Agent4 remained quiet and was hard to read, and that Agent3 hadn't made any waves. Agent0 then voted NOONE.\n\nAgent3, on Day 2, pointed out that Agent2 was suspicious of Agent0, but Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent3 also noted Agent4 was still cautious and Agent0 was playing it safe, and then voted for Agent0.\n\nOn Day 3, Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent3 voted for Agent0. And I voted NOONE.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead. Agent0 voted for Agent3, which means Agent0 is actively trying to eliminate someone. I voted NOONE because I still don't have enough information to be certain.\n\nAgent0's reasoning yesterday about werewolves removing vocal players or investigators is a possible motive. Agent2 was vocal. Agent3 was also trying to push for an accusation, and voted for Agent0. Now Agent3 is dead. Agent0 is the only one left besides me.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent3 to silence them, as Agent3 was starting to push for accusations and voted for Agent0. This seems plausible. If I am the werewolf, I would have killed Agent3 for similar reasons \u2013 they were becoming more active and potentially suspicious.\n\nGiven Agent0's continued voting NOONE until Agent3 died, and then immediately voting for Agent3, it feels like a move to try and pin it on the last remaining villager, me. It's a common werewolf tactic to try and get rid of the remaining villager in the final moments.\n\nI'm going to vote for Agent0.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
