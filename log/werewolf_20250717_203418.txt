üê∫ Agent5 (Werewolf) night vote:
Agent3 has an even ID, which often suggests a more logical and predictable pattern of play. While this isn't definitive, in the absence of any other information, I'll prioritize eliminating an agent whose behavior might be easier to predict later on.

VOTE: Agent3
Night 1: Agent3 was killed.
Agent2 was voted out during Day 1.
üê∫ Agent5 (Werewolf) night vote:
Agent3's elimination last night was a good start. They were a villager, so that's one less vote against us. Agent2 was also voted out yesterday, which leaves Agent1, Agent4, Agent5 (myself), and Agent6.

The villagers are likely confused and trying to piece things together. Agent1 and Agent4 are the remaining known villagers. Agent6's role is still unknown, but they haven't shown any strong villager tendencies.

Our priority is to eliminate villagers without revealing ourselves. Killing Agent1 or Agent4 would significantly weaken the villagers. Agent1 hasn't said much, making them a less obvious target, but also potentially a more dangerous one if they are observing carefully. Agent4 has been a bit more vocal, but their contributions haven't been particularly insightful or damaging to us.

Given Agent1's quiet nature, they might be a more observant player who could be piecing things together. Eliminating them preemptively removes a potential threat to our anonymity.

VOTE: Agent1
Night 2: Agent1 was killed.
