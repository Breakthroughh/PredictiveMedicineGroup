We don't have any information from investigations yet, as that usually happens on the first night too. So, we're going purely on suspicion and how people act.\n\nMy immediate thought is that the werewolf is probably trying to blend in. Anyone who is too quiet, or anyone who is too loud and aggressive, could be a suspect. We need to listen to what everyone else says and see if anyone's story doesn't add up.\n\nFor now, I don't have enough information to definitively point a finger at anyone.
