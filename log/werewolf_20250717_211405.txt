üê∫ Agent4 (Werewolf) night vote:
Agent1 has an even ID, and even numbers can sometimes be associated with trickery. It's a simple, purely random choice based on their number.

VOTE: Agent1
Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
Agent2 was voted out during Day 1.
üê∫ Agent4 (Werewolf) night vote:
Night 2. Agent1 is dead, and Agent2 was voted out. That means Agent3, Agent4 (me), Agent5, Agent6, Agent7, Agent8, Agent9, Agent10, Agent11, Agent12, Agent13, and Agent14 are still alive.

The villagers are likely confused after Agent1's death. They might be looking for patterns or trying to figure out who is acting suspiciously. Agent2's elimination suggests they might be looking for people who are too quiet or not contributing enough to the discussion.

As a werewolf, I need to eliminate someone who is a threat to us. Agent1 was a good choice because they had an even ID, which I used as a flimsy excuse to get them out of the way. Now, I need to consider who is the most likely to discover us.

Agent3 is a good target. They were active in the discussions yesterday, but their arguments weren't particularly compelling. They could be a villager trying to blend in, or they could be a wolf trying to appear helpful. Eliminating them removes a potential threat and also sows more discord among the remaining villagers. If Agent3 is a villager, it makes them look bad. If Agent3 is a wolf, it eliminates a teammate, which is not ideal, but is sometimes necessary to maintain the facade.

Alternatively, I could consider Agent5. They were very quiet yesterday. Villagers might see that as suspicious. Killing them would be a way to get rid of a potential villager who might be too observant, or to make the remaining villagers think the werewolves are going after the quiet ones.

However, Agent3's active, but not overtly convincing, role yesterday makes them a slightly more immediate threat in my opinion. They are trying to play the game, and that active play could lead to them uncovering something. Getting rid of them before they can gather too much information is a good strategy.

VOTE: Agent3
Night 2: Agent3 was killed.
No one was eliminated due to a tie.
