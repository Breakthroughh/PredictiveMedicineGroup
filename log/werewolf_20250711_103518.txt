üê∫ Agent2 (Werewolf) night vote:
Alright, Agent 2 reporting for duty. Let's assess the situation.

The villagers are still buzzing about the events of last night and the potential for another werewolf attack. They're clearly on edge, which is good for us.

Looking at who's still alive and the general sentiment:

*   **Agent1:** Was accused by Agent4 yesterday. Agent4's reasoning seemed a bit shaky, but it's definitely put Agent1 on the villagers' radar. If Agent4 is a villager, then Agent1 is a prime target for them, and we need to be careful about that. If Agent4 is a werewolf, then they're trying to deflect. Either way, Agent1 is a risky choice for them to keep around.

*   **Agent3:** Agent3 hasn't really done much to stand out one way or the other. They're a wildcard, and that can be dangerous for us if they are a villager who starts picking up on our patterns. Keeping a low profile is usually a good strategy for them.

*   **Agent4:** Agent4 made a play yesterday, accusing Agent1. This could be a brilliant move to appear villager-like, or it could be a desperate attempt to get a werewolf killed. If they are a villager, they're a decent investigator. If they are a werewolf, they're making themselves a target for the villagers.

The villagers discussed Agent1 and Agent4 yesterday. Agent1 is definitely being eyed, but Agent4's accusation might be making them look more innocent to some.

Given the current climate, eliminating Agent1 would be a solid move. It removes a potential threat from the villagers' perspective, especially if Agent4 is indeed a villager trying to root us out. It also keeps Agent4 in play, allowing them to continue their "investigation," which might distract from us for another night. Alternatively, we could eliminate Agent4 to try and confuse the villagers and make it seem like Agent1 was innocent. However, Agent1 is already under suspicion, so taking them out is less likely to raise immediate red flags that we are the ones doing it, especially if Agent4's accusation is still fresh in their minds. Agent1's "innocence" might be a better cover for us.

I think we should go after Agent1. It capitalizes on the existing suspicion and removes a player who could potentially be a solid villager investigator if they survive.

VOTE: Agent1
Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
No one was eliminated due to a tie.
üê∫ Agent2 (Werewolf) night vote:
Alright, let's review the aftermath of Night 1 and plan for tonight.

Last night, Agent1 was killed. This is... unexpected. The villagers' vote resulted in a tie, meaning no one was eliminated *by them*. However, Agent1 is dead. This implies the werewolves (us) took them out. My initial assessment suggested Agent1 was a good target to capitalize on existing suspicion. If that was our move, it was successful in removing a potential villager investigator from the game.

Now, looking at who's left and the situation:

*   **Agent3:** As I noted yesterday, Agent3 is still a wildcard. They haven't made any significant moves or accusations. This low profile is excellent for us if they're a villager, as they're not drawing attention to themselves or us. If they are a werewolf, they're playing it smart. They are a safe option to keep around for now.

*   **Agent4:** Agent4 made the accusation against Agent1 yesterday. If Agent1 was indeed killed by the werewolves last night, Agent4's accusation might now look either incredibly prescient (if they truly suspected Agent1 was a werewolf) or completely off the mark. If Agent4 is a villager, they're now under pressure to prove themselves. If they are a werewolf, they've either made a bold move that paid off or a risky one that might backfire if Agent1's death is attributed to us and Agent4's accusation seems unmotivated. Agent4 is definitely someone to keep an eye on; they've shown initiative.

The villagers are now aware that Agent1 is dead, and crucially, that no one was eliminated by their vote. This means they'll know *we* took someone out. The fact that Agent1 was the target of Agent4's suspicion yesterday might lead some villagers to believe Agent4 was on the right track and that Agent1 *was* the werewolf. This could bolster Agent4's credibility if they are a villager, or make them a prime suspect if they are a werewolf who *didn't* want Agent1 gone.

Our goal now is to continue sowing discord and eliminating threats without exposing ourselves. Agent4 is the most active player remaining. If Agent4 is a villager, they are likely to be investigating and trying to uncover the werewolves. If Agent4 is a werewolf, their previous accusation makes them a bit of a wild card, but keeping them alive could be a strategic advantage, or a liability. Eliminating Agent4 would be a strong move to remove a potentially valuable villager investigator, or a fellow werewolf who might be too erratic. However, the villagers might now assume Agent4 was a villager trying to expose Agent1, and if we kill Agent4, they might suspect Agent4 was correct and we are the remaining werewolves.

Given that Agent4 is the only player who has shown any proactive behavior in identifying a suspect, and that their previous accusation against Agent1 might now be seen as valid by the villagers due to Agent1's death, Agent4 poses a potential threat to us if they are a villager. They might continue to investigate or try to rally others based on their initial suspicion. Eliminating them now removes a potential leader or investigator for the villagers.
