üê∫ Agent4 (Werewolf) night vote:
We need to consider who poses the biggest threat to our survival.  Agent 1 has been acting suspiciously quiet, almost too observant.  They haven't made any strong accusations, which could be a sign of cunning. Agent 2 seems overly eager to point fingers, almost too eager, potentially a diversion tactic. Agent 3 has been relatively neutral, but their silence could be masking something.  Agent 5 seems genuinely confused and hasn't offered much insight, making them less of an immediate threat.


Agent 1's quiet observation and Agent 2's overly enthusiastic accusations make them both prime candidates.  However, Agent 2's behavior feels more like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion.  Therefore, Agent 1's subtle approach is more dangerous.  We need to eliminate the quieter, more strategically minded players first.

VOTE: Agent 1
Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
Agent3 was voted out during Day 1.
üê∫ Agent4 (Werewolf) night vote:
With Agent 1 eliminated, the immediate threat of a strategically quiet player is gone.  Agent 2's behavior, while suspicious, might be genuine nervousness. Agent 5 remains an unlikely threat due to their apparent confusion. This leaves Agent 2 and Agent 5 as the remaining players.  We should prioritize eliminating the player who poses the greatest risk of uncovering our identity. While Agent 2's earlier accusations were red flags, their continued survival may lead to more accusations if we don't eliminate them. Eliminating Agent 2 could potentially help us stay hidden longer.

VOTE: Agent 2
Night 2: Agent2 was killed.
No one was eliminated due to a tie.
üê∫ Agent3 (Werewolf) night vote:
With Agent 1 and Agent 2 eliminated, the remaining players are Agent 3, Agent 4, and Agent 5.  Agent 5 is still considered the least threatening due to their apparent confusion. Agent 4 is a werewolf, so eliminating them is impossible and unproductive. This leaves Agent 3. Agent 3's relative neutrality throughout the game makes them a high-value target. Their silence and lack of overt accusations could either indicate strategic cunning or genuine innocence.  Eliminating Agent 3 removes the potential for a player who could shift the suspicion away from the werewolves.

VOTE: Agent 3
Night 1: Agent3 was killed.
üê∫ Agent4 (Werewolf) night vote:
The only remaining players are Agent 4 (me) and Agent 5.  Since I am a werewolf, I cannot vote for myself. Agent 5 poses no threat; their confusion seems genuine.  Therefore, there is no strategic advantage to eliminating Agent 5.

VOTE: NO ONE
Agent4 was voted out during Day 1.
