Agent3 asked for our thoughts and was looking for evasiveness. I, Agent0, also stated I had no information and would reserve judgment. Nobody voted yesterday, which means we couldn't eliminate anyone, allowing the werewolf to strike again.\n\nNow, with Agent3 gone, it's just us three. The werewolf is definitely among us. Agent2 and Agent4, you both voted NOONE yesterday. This means you either didn't have a strong feeling, or you were trying to appear innocent. If either of you were the werewolf, voting NOONE would be a natural move to avoid suspicion.\n\nI need to consider who might have a motive or has acted suspiciously. Since we've had two nights of kills without any eliminations, it's possible the werewolf is trying to buy time. However, that's pure speculation at this point.\n\nLet's think about who benefits from these kills. Agent1 was killed first, then Agent3. Without any prior information, it's hard to say if these were targeted.\n\nAgent2, you mentioned not being ready to make an accusation. That's reasonable. Agent4, you said you were listening for slip-ups. We all did that, and no one slipped up.\n\nThe problem is, we're down to three, and one of us is the werewolf. If we vote NOONE again, the werewolf will almost certainly kill one of us tonight, leaving only two, with the werewolf having a much higher chance of survival. We *must* make a vote today.\n\nI need to consider who might be the most likely candidate. Since no one is offering any real leads, I have to consider who might have the most to gain by continuing this pattern. If the werewolf is trying to eliminate villagers, and we've lost Agent1 and Agent3, then perhaps the werewolf is trying to eliminate people who are vocal or who might have leadership potential.\n\nThis is incredibly difficult with so little information. However, to avoid losing again tonight, we have to pick someone.\n\nLet's consider the initial silence. We all voted NOONE. This means no one felt they *had* to vote for someone else. If I had to pick someone to scrutinize further, it would be difficult.\n\nI'm going to consider who has been the most passive. Agent2's statement yesterday was very measured. Agent4's was also measured. Agent3 was trying to solicit information.\n\nGiven that we *must* vote someone off, and no one has given me concrete evidence, I have to make a risky choice. Agent2's caution yesterday could be interpreted as trying to gather information, or it could be interpreted as laying low.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent4 voted NOONE, which means Agent4 is likely a villager, and they're trying to avoid making a wrong accusation. We are down to three, and one of us is the werewolf. Agent0 and Agent2 are actively trying to eliminate each other, which suggests one of them is the werewolf and the other is a villager who fell for the trick.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they would vote for Agent2 to try and get them eliminated. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they would vote for Agent0 to try and get them eliminated. Agent4's vote for NOONE is the most logical villager play when faced with such a direct conflict.\n\nSince Agent4 voted NOONE, they are likely a villager. Agent0 and Agent2 are in a deadlock. If I vote for Agent0, and Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent4 will be left alone with Agent2. If Agent2 is the werewolf, Agent4 will be left alone with Agent0. It's a risky situation.\n\nGiven that Agent0 voted for Agent2, and Agent2 voted for Agent0, I need to consider who is more likely the werewolf. Agent0's last statement was a bit more verbose in trying to analyze the situation and point fingers. Agent2's statement was also trying to dissect the situation.\n\nIf Agent4 is a villager, and we vote for one of the other two, we are still at risk of losing a villager. However, if I vote NOONE, the werewolf will definitely kill Agent4, and then it will be me and the werewolf.\n\nThe best play for the werewolves is to get the villagers to vote each other out. Agent0 and Agent2 are doing that. Agent4 is trying to be safe.\n\nThe werewolf wants to get rid of the most active investigators or the most suspicious people. Agent0 has been quite analytical. Agent2 has also been analytical.\n\nLet's assume Agent4 is a villager. The werewolf wants to eliminate the remaining villagers. If Agent0 is the werewolf, they want Agent2 gone. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they want Agent0 gone. Agent4's NO VOTE means Agent4 isn't picking a side.\n\nIf I pick Agent0, and Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent4 is left with me. If I pick Agent2, and Agent2 is the werewolf, then Agent4 is left with me.\n\nThis is a classic werewolf scenario where the werewolf tries to sow discord and have villagers vote each other out. Agent0 and Agent2 have fallen for it. I, as a villager, need to make a choice that either eliminates the werewolf or preserves the village as much as possible.\n\nIf I vote NOONE, Agent4 will be killed. That leaves me and the werewolf. That's not good.\n\nI have to choose between Agent0 and Agent2. Agent0's final statement was a bit more of a direct accusation towards Agent2, while Agent2's was more of an observation of Agent0's directness. It's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, as a werewolf, I want to sow chaos. Agent0 and Agent2 are already doing that by voting for each other. My best bet is to continue that. If I vote for Agent0, and Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent4 is left with me. If I vote for Agent2, and Agent2 is the werewolf, then Agent4 is left with me.\n\nLet's consider who might be a stronger opponent to the werewolf. Agent0's analysis felt a bit too much like they were trying to build a case. Agent2's analysis was also good, but Agent0's was more pointed.\n\nI'm going to vote for Agent0. This continues the chaos and hopefully eliminates one of the potential threats.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

The fact that no one was eliminated means the werewolf is either Agent2 or me.\n\nAgent2's reasoning for voting for Agent0 was that Agent0 was passive, and that they were both cautious. Agent0's reasoning for voting for Agent2 was that Agent2's caution was a ruse.\n\nNow, with Agent0 dead, it confirms that one of us three was the werewolf. Since Agent0 is dead, and they were voted for by Agent2, it suggests Agent2 might be the werewolf trying to deflect. However, Agent0 also voted for Agent2. This makes it very confusing.\n\nIf I was the werewolf, I would have voted NOONE yesterday to avoid drawing attention to myself. Since I did vote NOONE, it implies I'm a villager.\n\nThis leaves Agent2 as the most likely candidate. Agent2 voted for Agent0, and Agent0 voted for Agent2.
