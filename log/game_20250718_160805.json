(My vote was NOONE in that round, as I was not yet convinced about Agent1's target).\nDay 4: Agent1 voted for Agent0. Agent3, Agent2, Agent0 voted NOONE. (Again, my vote was NOONE because I still felt Agent1's accusation was weak and premature. Agent0 also voted NOONE). Wait, that's not right. I voted for Agent1 on Day 3 and Day 4. Let me re-read.\n\nAh, I see the problem. The logs show my previous statements.\nOn Day 2, I voted NOONE.\nOn Day 3, I voted NOONE.\nOn Day 4, I voted for Agent1. Agent2 also voted for Agent1. Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent1 voted for Agent0.\n\nSo, the votes on Day 4 were:\nAgent1: Agent0\nAgent3: Agent1\nAgent2: Agent1\nAgent0: NOONE\n\nThere was no majority, and Agent1 was killed during Night 4.\n\nNow, we have Agent0, Agent3 (me), and Agent2 left.\nAgent1's final action was to vote for Agent0. This is interesting because Agent1 previously targeted Agent0 with a weak accusation. Agent2 and I both voted for Agent1 on Day 4, suspecting them of being the werewolf or at least making a suspicious move. Agent0 remained neutral, voting NOONE.\n\nIf Agent1 was the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 to silence them or to sow confusion. But that doesn't make sense - the werewolf wouldn't kill themselves.\n\nTherefore, Agent1 was likely a villager, and the werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent2.\n\nAgent1's persistent targeting of Agent0, even when it didn't lead to an elimination, is still suspicious. It could be that Agent1 genuinely suspected Agent0, or it could be a deliberate attempt to frame Agent0.\n\nAgent2, you and I both voted for Agent1. What are your thoughts on Agent1's actions, and what do you make of Agent0's consistent NOONE votes and Agent1's final vote for them?\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent0 and Agent3 both voted NOONE yesterday. Agent2, like me, was suspicious of Agent1 for making that early, unsubstantiated vote.\n\nSince Agent1 was killed, it means the werewolf either didn't want Agent1 to be voted out by the villagers (perhaps Agent1 was a werewolf themselves, or they were close to figuring something out) or the werewolf wanted to eliminate Agent1 for other reasons.\n\nAgent1's initial vote against Agent0 seemed out of place. Now that Agent1 is dead, and the remaining players are Agent0, Agent3, and myself (Agent2), we need to be extremely careful.\n\nAgent0 and Agent3 have been consistently cautious and focused on information. My own strategy has been similar. Agent1's aggressive, albeit misguided, first vote made me suspicious of them. If Agent1 was trying to deflect, they failed because we didn't vote for Agent0.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was killed, and we have no other recent information to go on, it's hard to definitively say who the werewolf is. However, Agent1 was the only one to make a proactive, albeit questionable, vote yesterday.\n\nConsidering the information we have, and the fact that Agent1 was the target of the night kill, I'm going to re-examine my earlier suspicions. Agent1's behavior seemed the most out of line with the general caution.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
