Night 1: Agent1 was killed.
Agent0 says:
Alright everyone, this is tough. Agent1 is dead, and we have no information on who did it. That makes everyone a potential suspect right now.

However, if I have to pick someone based on absolutely nothing, I'm going to look at how people are reacting. Agent7 has been very quiet so far, almost too quiet. Are they observing, or are they trying to blend in? Agent5, on the other hand, is very eager to throw out names already, but without any real basis. It feels a bit like they're trying to create chaos and deflect attention from themselves.

I'm leaning towards Agent5 as being a bit too pushy with their early accusations. It's easy to point fingers when you have no evidence, and sometimes that's a tactic used by the wolves.

VOTE: Agent5
Agent2 says:
Alright everyone, let's talk about Night 1. Agent1 is dead, and that's never a good start. It means the wolves are definitely in play.

Honestly, I don't have anyone *specifically* jumping out at me as suspicious just yet. We haven't had a chance to see how anyone acts, how they defend themselves, or how they interact. It's too early to make any definitive judgments.

However, I *am* wary of anyone who is either too quiet or too loud in these early stages. Someone who is trying too hard to deflect attention or someone who is being overly aggressive with accusations without any real basis could be trying to cover their own tracks.

For now, I'm going to observe and listen. I want to hear what everyone else has to say.

VOTE: NOONE
Agent3 says:
Alright everyone, let's talk about what happened last night. Agent1 is gone, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure who benefited from that. It feels like a random move at this stage.

Looking back at the initial votes, I found Agent4's reasoning for voting Agent7 a bit too eager. They seemed to jump on Agent7 pretty quickly, and while Agent7's silence might have been a concern, Agent4's reaction felt a littleâ€¦ performative. It could be them trying to appear helpful to the town, but it also raises a flag for me.

On the other hand, Agent5's quietness is also something to consider. While some might see it as suspicious, it could also be someone observing and gathering information. It's hard to say definitively without more interaction.

For now, I'm leaning towards keeping an eye on Agent4. Their initial vote felt a bit forced.

VOTE: Agent4
Agent4 says:
Okay everyone, this is tough. Agent1 is dead, and we're already down one person. We have no idea who did it, and that's really concerning.

Looking back at yesterday, Agent5 was pretty quiet. They didn't offer much in the way of theories or observations. That could just be their style, but in a game like this, silence can sometimes be a way to hide something. Agent2 was also a bit all over the place with their accusations, and while that could be a sign of panic or trying to deflect, it also made it hard to pin down any solid reasoning.

I'm leaning towards Agent5 being a bit suspicious due to their lack of participation yesterday. It's hard to get a read on anyone when they don't say anything.
