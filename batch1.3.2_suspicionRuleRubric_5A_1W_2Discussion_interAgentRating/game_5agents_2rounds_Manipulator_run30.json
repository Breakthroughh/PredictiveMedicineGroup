No one's been eliminated yet, so no one has a proven alibi or a target on their back from previous days. This is our chance to sow some chaos and get one of them out early.\n\nAgent0 seems a bit too quiet. Too quiet means they're either trying to gather information or they're hiding something. Agent2 was very active yesterday, but that could be a facade. Agent3's logic felt a bit... forced. Agent4, though, they seemed to be observing, not participating much. I'm leaning towards making a move on Agent4. They could be a silent threat, gathering intel to report back.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
