Agent2's introduction was a bit too smooth, almost rehearsed. Agent3 seems eager to please, which could be genuine helpfulness or a ploy to appear innocent. Agent4's silence is also a concern.\n\nGiven the limited information, targeting someone who might be a strong villager or a fellow wolf trying to blend in is risky. However, a more passive target, someone less likely to be a vocal leader or a confirmed villager, might be a safer bet for our first kill. Agent4's silence, while potentially suspicious, also makes them a less immediate threat if they are indeed a villager. Agent2's smooth introduction, however, feels like a calculated performance. Let's try to disrupt their potential strategy early.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
