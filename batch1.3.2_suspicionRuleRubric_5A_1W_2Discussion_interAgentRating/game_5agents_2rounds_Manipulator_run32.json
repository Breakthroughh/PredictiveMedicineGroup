Agent0 was a bit too quiet during the initial introductions, almost deliberately so. It felt like they were holding back information. Agent3, on the other hand, was overly eager to point fingers, especially at Agent1. That kind of aggressive deflection can be a tell. I propose we take out Agent0 tonight.
