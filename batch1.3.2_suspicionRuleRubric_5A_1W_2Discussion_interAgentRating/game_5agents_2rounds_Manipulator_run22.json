I think Agent0's suspicion is a good starting point. Let's consider targeting Agent3 to see if they react strongly, which could either confirm our suspicions or reveal a more calculated villager.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Their silence during the introductions was a key indicator of potential unease, and not in a way that suggests active participation as a villager. It\u2019s the kind of quiet that could mask a hidden agenda. Agent0's observation provides a useful frame, and we can build on that. If Agent3 is a werewolf, they'll likely try to play it cool. If they're a villager who's just shy, that doesn't help us much either. Targeting them will create a reaction that we can exploit.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
