They kept focusing on Agent2's silence, which felt like a manufactured narrative to me. If they're that desperate to make a move, it suggests they might be trying to force an elimination before the group has a chance to truly observe. I think Agent1 is trying to control the narrative and might be a wolf themselves, or at least trying to shield someone. Let's target Agent1 to see if we can shake things up and expose any other wolves trying to cover for them.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
