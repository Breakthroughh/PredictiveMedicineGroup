It's crucial we don't draw attention to ourselves by being overly aggressive in our first kill. Let's consider someone who might try to \"lead\" the discussion early on, someone who might be too eager to play detective. Agent4 was quite vocal, but Agent1\u2019s focus on Agent3 is more suspicious to me.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

If we eliminate Agent3, it plays into Agent1's hand and makes them look like the insightful villager. We need to remove someone who might be seen as a threat, but not someone who has already been highlighted by another player. Agent4's initial verbosity could be interpreted as nervousness, a common villager trait when they don't know what to say. Let's shift focus to someone less obviously \"targeted\" but still a potential threat to our operations. Agent4 is a good candidate for a quiet elimination before they can establish themselves.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
