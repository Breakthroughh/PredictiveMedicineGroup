No one has been accused yet.\n\nOur goal is to thin the herd. We need to pick someone off. I'm thinking we should target someone who might draw attention early, or someone who seems a bit too quiet. It's a gamble, but if we can take out someone who might have been a strong villager, that's a win.\n\nAgent2 has been pretty silent so far in any potential (though not yet occurring) discussions. It's a coin toss, but maybe someone that quiet could be hiding something. Or, maybe they're just shy villagers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? We need to make a decision.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
