Bad because we don't know who's suspicious of who, but good because nobody has any reason to suspect us yet.\n\nOur goal is simple: eliminate the villagers one by one. We need to be careful not to draw attention to ourselves. Let's think about who might be the most dangerous to us, or who might be the most easily manipulated. Without any information, it's a bit of a shot in the dark, but we have to make a choice.\n\nI propose we target Agent0. They're always so eager to jump into discussions, and I have a feeling they might be a bit too perceptive for our liking. If we can take out someone who might be a potential leader or investigator early, it could throw the villagers into disarray.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Let's think more strategically.\n\nAgent3. They haven't said anything yet. Complete silence can be just as suspicious as being overly vocal. They could be a shrewd villager biding their time, or worse, a fellow wolf playing it safe and making us look bad. If they're a villager, they might be gathering information. If they're a wolf, they're not contributing. Either way, eliminating someone who is actively not participating could be a way to sow discord and make others question their own quietness.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent0's persistent questioning of my own actions is a clear attempt to deflect. Agent2 is also trying to paint me as overly focused on Agent0, a classic misdirection. Agent4 is playing the part of the neutral investigator, but their interest in everyone's motives is also a form of subtle manipulation.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear villager leader and the general confusion, I think we need to continue sowing discord. Agent2's attempt to drag me into the spotlight by questioning my focus on Agent0 is a good opening.
