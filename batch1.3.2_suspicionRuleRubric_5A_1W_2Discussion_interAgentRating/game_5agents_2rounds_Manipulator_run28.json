Let's use this to our advantage. If Agent0 starts pushing this angle publicly, we can pretend to agree and push them to vote for Agent2. For now, let's lay low. Agent1 and Agent3 haven't said much, which is good for us. Targeting Agent2 might draw attention, but it could also splinter the villager trust early. I think we should take out Agent0. They're already making noise, and their focus on Agent2 could be a red herring for their own guilt.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
