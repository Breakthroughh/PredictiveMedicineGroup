We don't want to look too aggressive, but we also need to thin the herd. Who seems most likely to cause trouble for us down the line? Someone who might be observant or naturally suspicious.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2. They haven't said anything yet, which in my experience can either mean they're quiet and observant, or they're just waiting to see what everyone else does before they make a move. If they're observant, they could be a problem.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
