Even though it's Night 1 and there haven't been discussions, we can assume some players might be naturally more talkative or have expressed opinions that could be misinterpreted.\n\nAgent0 has been quiet so far, which could be good or bad. Agent1 and Agent2 seem like they might be more prone to panic or making rash decisions, which could be useful to exploit later. Agent3 is currently unknown.\n\nGiven it's the first night, a safe play is to target someone who might be seen as a leader or someone who could rally the villagers against us if they were to become suspicious. However, we don't have enough information yet to make a truly informed decision.\n\nLet's consider the potential for immediate suspicion. If we target someone who has been completely silent, it might be seen as an attempt to remove a neutral party. If we target someone who has been *too* vocal, it might be seen as silencing a potential threat.\n\nFor now, let's play it safe. I don't want to draw too much attention to us with an aggressive first kill. Who is the least likely to cause trouble or be an immediate threat to us?\n\nI'm leaning towards eliminating someone who hasn't made themselves a target.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
