If we can take out a villager each night, we'll be in a winning position.\n\nAgent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent4. Who's the most suspicious? Agent0's been a bit too quiet, almost suspiciously so. Agent1, on the other hand, was very vocal, maybe trying to draw attention away from themselves? Agent2 seemed to be analyzing things, which could be smart villager play or a calculated werewolf move. Agent4 hasn't really made a strong impression either way.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. Their silence feels like they're *waiting* for something, perhaps for us to make a mistake. Or, they could be a clever villager trying to blend in, letting others do the talking. But a quiet player can also be a dangerous one, observing and waiting for the right moment to strike with accusations. Let's take them out and see how the others react.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

It suggests a calculated reserve, a deliberate attempt to avoid drawing any attention, which is precisely what a werewolf trying to lay low would do. They're not engaging, not offering theories, just observing. This passive approach is a strong indicator of someone who doesn't need to defend themselves with words because they have other methods. We need to disrupt their plan before they can fully assess the villager's suspicions.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
