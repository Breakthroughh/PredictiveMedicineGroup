My gut tells me Agent2 has been a little too quiet so far. It's the kind of calculated silence that could hide something. Or maybe Agent3's overly eager participation is a smokescreen. Let's not make any rash decisions, but I lean towards taking out someone who hasn't revealed much. Agent2 feels like the safest bet to disrupt their plans without drawing too much attention to ourselves.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
