We need to make a move that benefits us. Killing a known villager will reduce their numbers, but killing someone who might be suspected by others could sow more chaos and misdirection.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent3. They've been quiet so far, which could be a sign of careful observation, or it could be them playing it safe until the right moment to strike. If they're a villager, we eliminate one of them. If they're a werewolf, well, that's less ideal, but it also means we've got one less person to worry about in our own ranks. It's a calculated risk.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
