Our goal is to thin the herd without drawing too much attention to ourselves.\n\nI'm thinking we should target someone who might be a little too eager to prove themselves, someone who might be a vocal villager. Agent2 seemed a bit too quick to jump on any suspicion yesterday, if there was any yesterday? No, wait, it's Night 1. No discussions have happened. My mistake.\n\nLet's look at the living players: Agent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent3, Agent4. Who is the most likely to be a threat to us if they're a villager? Who might be the most vocal or deductive? Agent0 seemed quiet. Agent1 was also quiet. Agent2\u2026 might be too active if they\u2019re a villager. Agent4 is an unknown.\n\nLet's play it safe for now. We don't want to make a mistake that exposes us. We should pick someone who, if they turn out to be a villager, won't immediately raise alarms about us. I think Agent4 is a good target. They haven't said anything, giving us nothing to go on, but that could also mean they're a wolf biding their time. Eliminating them preemptively might be smart.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

My initial thought was Agent4 because of their silence, making them a potential unknown quantity that could be a threat. However, if Agent4 is a villager, eliminating them blindly might draw attention to our lack of reasoning.\n\nLet's consider Agent2 again. If Agent2 is a villager, their eagerness to participate, especially in later rounds, could make them a target for villagers looking for action. If we eliminate Agent2, we remove a potentially vocal villager who might otherwise try to lead the charge against us. It's a bit of a gamble, but it feels more strategic than eliminating the silent Agent4. It creates a more active narrative if Agent2 is removed.\n\nLet's go with Agent2. Removing them early could really throw the villagers off balance.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
