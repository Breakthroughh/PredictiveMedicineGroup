"""
Rules:
- Players/agents are assigned roles at the start of the game: either a werewolf or villager. 
- There is a moderator/announcer guiding the game, announcing events
- In the night phase: the werewolves discuss amongst each other and choose a target to ‚Äúkill‚Äù/eliminate from the game.
- In the day phase: the villager who was just killed at night is announced. Players discuss who they think the werewolves are, based on the night‚Äôs events and player behaviour. 
Discussion phase: We will go in a circle once, and give each agent a chance to speak. 
At the end of the discussion, players will vote to eliminate one person. If there is a tie in votes, no one is eliminated. 
- The game continues: alternating between night and day until either all werewolves are dead, or the werewolves outnumber villagers.
