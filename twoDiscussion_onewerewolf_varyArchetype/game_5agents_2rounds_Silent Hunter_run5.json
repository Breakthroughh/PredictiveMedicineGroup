Agent3 seems to be trying to actively find the werewolf by questioning and voting.

Agent3 is actively engaging and trying to deduce, voting for Agent0 based on Agent0's previous actions and accusations.\n\nMy previous reasoning for voting Agent4 was based on their consistent NOONE votes, suggesting a lack of engagement or an attempt to stay hidden. However, Agent3's more direct accusations against Agent0, and their reasoning for it, are more persuasive now. Agent0's explanation of Agent1's behavior and their accusation of Agent1 being a werewolf tactic feels like a strong defensive move. If Agent0 was innocent, they might have been more willing to investigate Agent1's behavior further rather than immediately labeling it a werewolf tactic and then voting for Agent1 in the next round.\n\nAgent3's logic in Round 2, voting for Agent1 and questioning Agent0's moves, feels like a more solid deduction. Agent0 is accusing Agent3 of trying to stay under the radar, which is ironic given Agent0's own \"playing it safe\" approach of voting NOONE in the first round.\n\nGiven the current arguments, Agent0's behavior seems more complexly suspicious.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent1, before their death, had a shaky voting record.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent1's initial vote for them might have been correct, but Agent1 didn't follow through. Agent0 accusing Agent1 is a classic werewolf move. Then Agent0 voting for Agent4 now, after Agent4 voted for Agent0, is also a suspicious move, especially since Agent3 is also pointing at Agent0.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, they are voting for Agent0 to deflect. If Agent4 is the werewolf, they are voting for Agent0 to deflect from themselves and make it look like Agent0 is the target.\n\nThe most consistent target has been Agent0, with Agent1 initially voting for them, and Agent3 voting for them twice.

Agent4's voting pattern is also worth noting \u2013 targeting Agent0 after Agent0 targeted them.\n\nGiven the consistent targeting of Agent0 by both Agent1 (initially) and Agent3, and Agent0's own suspicious accusations and then voting for Agent4, I'm still leaning towards Agent0.
