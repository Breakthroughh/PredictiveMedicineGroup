This is a sound villager strategy. Agent 1's statement about Agent 3 asking good questions about Agent 4's elimination is correct, and my continued focus on understanding the werewolf's motives is what any rational villager would do.\n\nAgent 0 is trying to create a narrative where my measured approach is suspicious. They are essentially saying, \"If you're not accusing, you must be hiding something.\" This is a common werewolf tactic to force an early accusation and potentially eliminate a villager who is a threat.\n\nGiven this, I believe Agent 0's sudden attempt to target me is a sign of desperation.

Werewolves might eliminate those who are quietly piecing things together.\n\nI, as Agent1, have been consistent in my cautious approach. I haven't made strong accusations, which aligns with what Agent0 and Agent3 have also done in the earlier rounds.
