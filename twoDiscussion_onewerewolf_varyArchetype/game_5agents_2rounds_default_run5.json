If Agent0 *is* a werewolf, they would want to sow discord and eliminate a potential threat or get a villager lynched. Agent2's consistent NOONE votes, even when a werewolf is clearly active, are making them look suspicious to me as well. They are providing no information and not participating in the elimination process.\n\nHowever, we cannot afford another night without an elimination. Agent4 has correctly identified that both Agent0 and Agent2 have been passive. Since Agent4 voted for me (Agent0), and I voted for Agent2, and Agent2 voted NOONE, it's clear that the villagers (or at least, Agent4) are suspicious of both of us.\n\nTo maintain the illusion and continue the game, I need to make a move that appears to be in the village's best interest. Agent2's silence and lack of contribution are making them the most likely suspect to a villager.

Agent4 has been accusing both Agent0 and Agent2 of being passive, but Agent4's own contributions were also about waiting for information.

This flip-flopping and continued passive play is very suspicious. Agent0's rationale for voting for Agent2 was that Agent2 was quiet, but Agent0 was also quiet, and Agent0's own play has been very measured. Agent4 correctly identified the passivity of both Agent0 and Agent2. My vote has been consistent, focusing on what seems like deflection from Agent0.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

The fact that Agent2 was killed last night, and Agent4's narrative has consistently been about rooting out the passive players, makes Agent4's focus on me seem like a diversion.\n\nI have been trying to play as a villager, making logical deductions based on the available information, even if that means being cautious. Agent4's accusations are themselves a tactic to appear as a concerned villager. Since we are down to two, and the werewolf is clearly trying to eliminate me, I need to make my final accusation as confidently as possible. Agent4's strategy of accusing me while being equally passive is a classic werewolf move.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

You also accused Agent4 of flip-flopping, but your own voting pattern has been less clear than Agent4's consistent focus on the most passive players. Agent2's death, after voting NOONE, is unfortunate, but it doesn't automatically mean Agent4 is the wolf.
