Agent2 remained neutral, and I also remained neutral. Now, Agent4 is dead. Agent3 voted for Agent4 in the previous round. It's possible the werewolf is trying to eliminate those who suspect them or those who are actively trying to identify them. Agent3's initial suspicion of Agent4, followed by Agent4's pushback and vote for Agent3, makes Agent3 a potential suspect *if* Agent4 was a villager and was trying to expose the werewolf. Conversely, if Agent3 is the werewolf, they might have been trying to deflect attention by pointing to Agent4, and then the werewolf (or another werewolf if there are two) killed Agent4 to remove a perceived threat or someone who might have been getting too close.\n\nHowever, Agent4 was also the one who directly asked for opinions and then voted for Agent3. This could be a play to get a villager lynched, or it could be Agent4 trying to bait the werewolf into revealing themselves. The fact that Agent4 was killed after voting for Agent3 is interesting. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent4 to silence them or to prevent Agent3 from being lynched in retaliation.\n\nAgent2 has been very passive.

Agent3's focus on Agent4 might have been correct, and Agent4 could have been a villager, making Agent3 the werewolf. Or, Agent4 could have been the werewolf, trying to make Agent3 look bad, and then got killed by another werewolf, or perhaps they were killed by a villager who suspected them after their aggressive voting.\n\nI'm going to lean towards the theory that Agent3's initial suspicion was warranted, and they are the werewolf.
