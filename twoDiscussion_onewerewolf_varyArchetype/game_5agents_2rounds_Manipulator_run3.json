Agent3 noted the confusion regarding Agent4's supposed vote.\n\nAgent2 then pivoted to observing Agent1's \"defensiveness\" and Agent3's \"villager observation tactics,\" while reiterating their hesitation about Agent4's \"quickness\" (which was still based on the incorrect premise of Agent4 voting).\n\nMy vote for Agent2 in the last round was based on their clear factual error about Agent4's actions. This error could have been a genuine mistake, but in a game where every word matters, it felt like a potential attempt to sow discord or mislead. Since Agent2 was killed, it's highly likely they were a villager, and the werewolf wanted them silenced because they were close to figuring something out, or perhaps Agent2 was just a random target.\n\nNow, we have Agent1, Agent3, and Agent4 left. Agent4 correctly identified Agent2's mistake about their vote. Agent1 also acknowledged the mistake. Agent3 was also confused by the statement.\n\nAgent4 was trying to build a narrative around Agent0's \"quick conviction\" in Round 1, which I found a bit strange as I hadn't actually voted or made a strong conviction then.

Agent4, while also correcting Agent2, is still somewhat fixated on my early statements. Agent3 remains a quiet observer.\n\nWith Agent2 gone, and their motive for death unclear (perhaps they were close to figuring things out, or just a random target), I'm looking at who benefits from the confusion or who has been the most passive. Agent1's consistent NOONE votes and somewhat contradictory statements about awareness of game events are still raising red flags. Agent3's continued observation is fine, but doesn't help much. Agent4's initial critique of my \"quick conviction\" was odd, but they did correctly identify Agent2's misstatement.\n\nI still think Agent1 is the most suspicious due to their lack of concrete contribution and their slightly evasive responses regarding the game's progress.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent3 correctly pointed out the confusion surrounding Agent4's supposed vote and noted my continued quietness.\n\nAgent0 is now voting for Agent4, stating that my initial assessment of their Round 1 statement was a mischaracterization and their focus on my early actions was \"off.\" This feels like a deflection. Agent0, you are a villager trying to deduce the werewolf. Your statement about my \"quick conviction\" in Round 1 was simply me observing that Agent0 was making a statement about Agent1 that seemed premature. I didn't vote for anyone then. Agent0's current vote for me seems like an attempt to shift focus away from themselves.\n\nAgent1 has voted for me for two rounds now, based on a perceived defensiveness and a statement about not being aware of votes being cast. I maintain that my statement was simply me reacting to Agent2's comment about Agent4 voting, and I was genuinely trying to understand the game state.\n\nAgent3 is still observing and has now voted for Agent1. Their reasoning is that Agent1's continued silence is the most suspicious.\n\nGiven that Agent2 is dead, and Agent0 and Agent4 were on the same page about Agent2's errors, I am now more suspicious of Agent0 for their vote against me. Agent0 is mischaracterizing my Round 1 statement as a \"conviction\" and is now trying to paint my logical observations as a \"deflection.\"\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent4's focus on this seems a bit misdirected.\n\nAgent3's reasoning for voting NOONE in the last round was that they had \"very little to go on with Agent1.\" This is understandable, but doesn't help us move forward.\n\nGiven that Agent2 is dead, and both Agent0 and Agent4 correctly identified Agent2's errors, they seem to be acting as villagers. Agent1's consistent lack of definitive action and passive voting, despite acknowledging misstatements from others, is what makes me suspicious.

In Round 2, Agent4 corrected Agent2 about their vote and pointed out Agent1's reserved nature. Agent4 seems to be trying to piece things together by identifying misstatements and perceived behaviors.\n\nAgent1, you've been very quiet, only making neutral statements about observing. Your response to Agent2 claiming Agent4 voted for you was to state you weren't aware of any votes, which Agent4 and Agent0 clarified was correct. You've stuck to being observational.\n\nAgent0 correctly identified Agent2's misstatement and voted them out. Agent0 then commented that my observation of their silence was nuanced, and also that Agent1's statement was standard. Agent0's vote for Agent2 suggests they believed Agent2 was problematic.\n\nI voted NOONE last round, focusing on Agent1 as my suspicion due to their silence. Agent4 also voted NOONE, and Agent1 voted NOONE. Agent0 voted for Agent2.\n\nNow, Agent0 is voting for Agent4. Agent4 is voting for NOONE. Agent1 is voting for Agent1. And I am voting for Agent1.\n\nAgent0 believes Agent4's focus on their \"quick conviction\" was a mischaracterization and potentially an attempt to deflect. Agent4, on the other hand, is still focused on Agent1's passivity. Agent1 continues to vote for themselves, which is odd if they're a villager trying to survive. If they were a werewolf, voting for themselves would be a strange move, almost like trying to look innocent by being a \"target\" or throwing suspicion on themselves to avoid being discovered.\n\nI'm going to stick with my suspicion of Agent1. Their persistent silence and now voting for themselves is too suspicious. It feels like a way to avoid saying anything that could incriminate them, or perhaps a very misguided attempt at a villager strategy.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
