Agent0, you've been consistent in trying to identify a suspect, even if it led to Agent1 and then Agent2 being eliminated. Agent4, your votes have been more erratic, first questioning me, then voting for Agent0, and now Agent2 is dead. It's hard to say who the werewolf is at this point with such limited information and so many deaths.\n\nI'm going to go with my gut feeling. Agent0's consistent focus on finding a werewolf, even if misdirected, feels more like a villager's drive. Agent4's shifting suspicions and voting patterns feel a little more strategic to avoid being targeted themselves.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
