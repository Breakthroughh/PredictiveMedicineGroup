Agent2 was consistently pushing for observation and had no suspicion of anyone. Agent3 was also observational and focused on how Agent0 died. Agent4 was also cautious and waiting for more information.\n\nIf the werewolf is trying to eliminate people asking questions, Agent1 fits that profile. If the werewolf is just trying to cause chaos, then anyone could be next.\n\nI need to think about who *didn't* say much. Agent2, Agent3, and Agent4 all made statements about observing or needing more information. Agent1 was more proactive.\n\nLet's consider this: if a werewolf wants to blend in, they'd likely follow the group's caution. However, if they want to eliminate active investigators, then the cautious people become targets.\n\nGiven Agent1's role in asking questions, their death doesn't *necessarily* point to any of us.
