Agent1 and Agent2 are too busy arguing with each other to effectively investigate. Agent0's vote for Agent3 was a bit out of left field, and it might have been a strategic move to appear innocent or to try and eliminate a potential threat.\n\nGiven the current dynamic, Agent1's continued focus on Agent2 and Agent3's consistent suspicion of me makes them the most disruptive players. However, we need to eliminate someone who could potentially rally the others. Agent0's unpredictable vote in the last round makes them a wild card, but their silence otherwise is still a concern. Agent2 is making claims about strong players and targeting others. Agent1 is accusing Agent2 of deflection and Agent3 of being too quick to suspect.\n\nTo keep the chaos going and prevent any unified investigation, I think we need to remove Agent0. Their unpredictable vote makes them hard to read, and they could be a genuine threat to us or a clever wolf themselves.

      "content": "Agent0 is dead, and they voted for Agent3 last night. Agent3 voted for Agent0 in the previous round. This pattern is confusing. If Agent0 was the werewolf, then Agent3's vote for Agent0 was a villager correctly identifying the werewolf. If Agent3 was the werewolf, then Agent0 was killed for voting for them.\n\nLet's break down the votes:\nRound 1:\nAgent1: NOONE\nAgent2: Agent1\nAgent3: Agent0\nAgent0: NOONE\n\nRound 2:\nAgent1: Agent2\nAgent2: Agent1\nAgent3: Agent0\nAgent0: Agent3 (killed)\n\nNow, with Agent0 dead, we have Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\nAgent3 voted for Agent0 in both rounds, and Agent0 is now dead. This makes Agent3 a strong suspect for being a werewolf, as they consistently voted for Agent0, and then Agent0 was killed. It's possible Agent0 was killed *because* Agent3 targeted them, or Agent0 was indeed the werewolf and Agent3 was trying to eliminate them, but the werewolf killed Agent0 to prevent this.\n\nAgent1 voted NOONE, then Agent2, then Agent3.\nAgent2 voted Agent1, then Agent1, then Agent1.\nAgent3 voted Agent0, then Agent0, then Agent0.\n\nAgent1 and Agent2 have been voting for each other, which could be a classic werewolf tactic to create confusion and eliminate each other, or it could be genuine suspicion. However, Agent3's consistent targeting of Agent0, followed by Agent0's death, is the most compelling piece of evidence so far. If Agent0 was a villager, Agent3 is trying to get villagers killed. If Agent0 was the werewolf, Agent3's actions are either correct villager actions or a lucky guess.\n\nConsidering Agent3's consistent vote for Agent0, and Agent0's subsequent death, I think Agent3 is the most likely werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
