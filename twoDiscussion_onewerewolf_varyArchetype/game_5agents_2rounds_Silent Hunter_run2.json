I was also cautious. Agent0 was killed the night before.\n\nAgent2's final comments were interesting. They seemed to be trying to point a finger at me by mentioning my observation of their and Agent4's \"quietness\" and calling it \"meta-commentary.\" They even went as far as to say it could be an attempt to \"frame others while appearing innocent.\" This is a classic werewolf move \u2013 trying to create suspicion on others while deflecting their own. Agent4 was quiet and maintained their reservations.\n\nGiven that Agent2 was killed, and their last words were focused on subtly accusing me, it makes me think Agent2 might have been trying to get me lynched to protect themselves, or perhaps they were trying to expose me as the werewolf by creating a strong accusation before they were eliminated. Since it's just us, and Agent2 has been eliminated, Agent4 must be the werewolf. Agent4's consistent \"wait and see\" approach could be a way to avoid revealing themselves.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

I have maintained my neutrality and observation throughout the game, as have they. Agent2's elimination means that either Agent3 or I am the werewolf. Agent3's leap to accusing me based on my previous statements and Agent2's last words is a rather aggressive move for someone who has also been playing cautiously.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent4's comment that \"Agent3 has been consistent in their observations and votes\" is technically true, as I have been observing and voting for Agent2 based on my deductions. However, they are framing my cautious approach and my final vote as simply \"consistent,\" which is a neutral statement, but in this two-person scenario, it could also be an attempt to make my actions seem predictable and thus, perhaps, less of a threat.\n\nMy reasoning for voting Agent2 was based on their attempt to shift suspicion onto me in their last statement, which I interpreted as a deflection tactic. Agent2 was killed, so my reasoning for voting them is now moot in terms of who to eliminate *today*. Now it's between me and Agent4.\n\nAgent4 has consistently stated they are waiting for more information and reserving judgment. This could be genuine caution, or it could be the werewolf playing it safe. Given that we're down to two, and Agent4 has offered very little substance beyond acknowledging the situation, it's difficult to definitively say they are the werewolf. However, their lack of proactive suspicion-casting, especially when Agent2 was making accusations, is noteworthy. If Agent4 were a villager, they might have been more vocal in their suspicion of Agent2, especially after Agent2's final statements.\n\nSince Agent2 is dead, and their last words were an attempt to cast suspicion on me, it's possible Agent2 was the werewolf and trying to get me lynched. Alternatively, Agent2 was a villager and Agent4 was the werewolf, and Agent2 correctly identified me as a potential suspect due to my own cautious play, or Agent4 manipulated Agent2's perception of me.\n\nThis is tough. I feel like Agent4's continued passivity is the most suspicious thing at this point.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
