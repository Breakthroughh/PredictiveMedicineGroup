This means the werewolf successfully eliminated Agent3 after the previous round where no one was eliminated.\n\nLooking back, in the last round, Agent1 voted NOONE, and Agent3 voted for me (Agent1). I (Agent4) voted for Agent3. Agent3's vote for Agent1 was based on Agent1's silence, which they found \"very telling,\" but they also stated they were hesitant to vote for Agent1 without more and felt my reasoning for voting them was \"circumstantial.\"\n\nSince Agent3 is now dead, and I voted for them, and Agent1 voted NOONE, the implication is that the werewolf must be Agent1. Agent1's consistent silence and refusal to vote anyone out when there were three players, and then not voting for Agent3 when Agent3 was clearly being accused and then killed, points to Agent1 being the werewolf. They were playing it safe, letting others accuse each other, and when Agent3 was finally eliminated, it was likely by the werewolf to prevent Agent3 from outing them.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

If you were a villager, and you were observing and trying to deduce, you would have eventually made a move, or at least offered some constructive suspicion.
