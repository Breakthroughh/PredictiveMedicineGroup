Agent0 and Agent4 both seemed to target Agent1 in their votes, but Agent1's final vote was for Agent4. This could mean Agent4 was genuinely suspicious to Agent1, or it could be a werewolf trying to get another player out. Agent0's reasoning for voting Agent1 (that Agent1's vote on Agent0 was suspicious) seems a bit weak on its own. Agent4's reasoning for voting Agent1 (that Agent1 was deflecting by voting Agent0) also has some merit.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent4 as a potential werewolf due to their aggressive targeting of Agent1 in the previous round, and then Agent1 voting for Agent4 at the end. It could be a werewolf trying to eliminate a threat, or a werewolf trying to frame someone.
