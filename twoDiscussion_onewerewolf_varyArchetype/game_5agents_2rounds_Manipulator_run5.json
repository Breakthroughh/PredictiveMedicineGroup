Agent4's approach of \"no information yet\" and \"no suspicious behavior\" feels a little too passive for someone who claims to be looking for clues. It's almost as if they are intentionally avoiding any potential suspicion. Agent2, while stating the obvious, is at least acknowledging the need for a werewolf presence. Agent3 is also playing it safe.\n\nGiven that we still have no solid leads, I'm going to stick to my strategy of observing.

Agent2, while cautious, didn't commit to a vote. My own vote for Agent4 was based on that perceived passivity and deflection.\n\nNow, with Agent3 being the most vocal about suspicion, they've put themselves on the radar, but not necessarily as a werewolf. If Agent3 *is* a villager, they are a useful ally for pushing action. If Agent3 *is* a werewolf, they are making a bold, perhaps reckless, play by accusing another player so early.\n\nAgent2 remains on the fence, and their silence could be interpreted in multiple ways \u2013 either they are genuinely observing, or they are a werewolf waiting for the opportune moment. Agent4, on the other hand, is still playing the \"passive observer\" role, which is exactly what a werewolf trying to blend in might do.\n\nGiven that Agent3 was the one pushing for action and pointing fingers, eliminating them might seem like a \"werewolf move\" to protect an ally. However, if Agent3 is a villager, we are losing a valuable voice. Conversely, if Agent4 is the werewolf, their strategy of appearing non-threatening and encouraging inaction might be working.\n\nI think we need to remove someone who is potentially a threat to our operation. Agent3 has shown a willingness to take risks and point fingers. If they are a villager, they could rally others. If they are a werewolf, they are being too obvious.

If they are a villager, they are doing a very poor job of investigating. If they are a werewolf, they are playing it cool and letting others make the moves. Agent2's decision to vote NOONE twice, while saying they are observing, is also quite telling. They haven't committed, which could be strategic caution or werewolf indecision.\n\nGiven that Agent3 was specifically targeting Agent4 yesterday, and Agent4 remained completely unreactive and voted NOONE, it makes Agent4 seem more suspect.

No majority, Agent3 killed.\n\nAgent3 and Agent1 both voted for me in Round 2. Agent2 voted NOONE in both rounds and is now saying that Agent3's death points to me. If Agent2 is a villager, they are being very cautious and perhaps trying to let the werewolf and the true villagers eliminate each other. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they are trying to solidify the vote against me.\n\nAgent1 was also suspicious of my passivity. Agent3 was directly accusing me. If Agent1 is a villager, they are being swayed by Agent3's accusation and my past behavior. If Agent1 is the werewolf, they are trying to eliminate a potential threat (me, if I'm a villager) or a fellow werewolf (Agent3, if Agent1 is the other werewolf).\n\nGiven that Agent3 was killed after targeting me, and Agent2 and Agent1 are now both pointing at me, it's a strong indication that I might be perceived as the werewolf. As a villager, I need to defend myself. However, the logic that Agent3 was killed because they were getting close to the truth (and that truth pointed to me) is compelling. If Agent3 was a werewolf, the other werewolf eliminated them.\n\nThis is a tricky situation. If I vote NOONE, and Agent1 and Agent2 vote for me, I will be eliminated. If I vote for Agent1 or Agent2, and they don't vote for me, I might survive. However, the evidence is stacking up against me. Agent3 was killed after calling me out. Agent2 is directly accusing me. Agent1 is also leaning towards me. The most strategic move for me, as a villager, is to try and get the *actual* werewolf eliminated.\n\nAgent2 is still playing very cautiously, voting NOONE. Agent1 is also being careful. My best bet is to try and catch the other werewolf. If Agent3 was the werewolf, then either Agent1 or Agent2 is the other werewolf. If Agent3 was a villager, then either Agent1 or Agent2 is the werewolf.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed *after* targeting me is the biggest piece of information. It strongly suggests the werewolf is trying to eliminate threats or silence people who are close. Agent2 is now pushing the idea that I am the werewolf. If Agent2 is a villager, they are misinterpreting the situation or being manipulated. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they are trying to get me out.\n\nAgent1's reasoning is also based on Agent3's accusation. It's a domino effect. I will vote for Agent2. Agent2's consistent NOONE votes and then their strong accusation against me after Agent3's death feels like a calculated play by the werewolf to deflect.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
