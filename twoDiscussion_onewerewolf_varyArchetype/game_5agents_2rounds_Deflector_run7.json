Agent1's emphasis on paying attention to arguments and Agent4's focus on deduction make them potentially more dangerous if they happen to be villagers with good instincts. Agent2 has been more passively observant, making them a less immediate target.\n\nBetween Agent1 and Agent4, Agent4's explicit mention of the werewolf targeting \"good deducers\" feels slightly more pointed, suggesting they might be trying to subtly probe or perhaps even hint at what a werewolf might be thinking.
