My own strategy has been to blend in and not draw attention.\n\nGiven that Agent0 has remained relatively quiet and consistent in their cautious approach, and I've also maintained a similar stance, it would be highly suspicious for me to suddenly make a strong accusation. It's best to maintain the appearance of uncertainty and try to get Agent0 to make the first move, or we can both continue to observe.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

Agent3 was killed after expressing frustration that we couldn't differentiate anyone and that voting was just a guess. My initial thoughts align with yours about caution.
