Agent2 is still playing it incredibly safe, which is always suspicious. Their \"NOONE\" votes could be genuine caution, or a werewolf waiting for the perfect moment. My suspicion of Agent2 last round was based on their silence, and Agent3 is now turning it around and saying my *actions* were suspicious.\n\nHonestly, both Agent2 and Agent3 have ways of looking suspicious. Agent3 is now actively trying to get me voted out, which is a strong move, but could also be a werewolf trying to eliminate their biggest accuser. Agent2's consistent neutrality, however, is starting to feel like a deliberate strategy to avoid drawing attention. They haven't really offered any theories or explanations, just observed. That kind of passive play can be a hallmark of a werewolf who doesn't want to commit to anything.\n\nI think Agent2 is the most dangerous right now because their lack of engagement makes them hard to read and allows them to avoid revealing any tells. Let's get rid of the quiet one.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
