But now Agent1 is dead. Agent4's current vote is NOONE, which is a bit odd if they thought Agent1 was the werewolf and now are suspicious of no one.\n\nAgent3 voted for Agent0, based on the reasoning that Agent1 targeted Agent0 and then Agent1 was killed, suggesting Agent0 might be the werewolf. This is a plausible deduction.\n\nAgent0 is still being cautious and deferring.

Agent3's vote for Agent0 is the most direct accusation based on the chain of events.\n\nI'm still leaning towards Agent0.
