Agent0 is suspicious of Agent1's actions, and since Agent1 is dead, Agent0 is now backing Agent3's caution.\n\nThe fact that Agent0 voted NOONE yesterday, after claiming to be suspicious of Agent1, is odd. Why not vote for Agent1 if they were suspicious? Agent0's sudden trust in Agent3's caution feels like a way to align and deflect. Agent3's continued suspicion of Agent0, however, is based on Agent0's *own* words about Agent1 targeting them. It's a bit circular.\n\nGiven that Agent3 and I both identified Agent1 as suspicious, and Agent0 also voted for Agent1 yesterday, it suggests we were all on a similar track about Agent1. Agent0's shift to NOONE was the most out of step. Agent3 has been consistent in their suspicion of Agent1, and now of Agent0.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
