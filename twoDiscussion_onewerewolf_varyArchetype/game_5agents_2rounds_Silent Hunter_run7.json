Agent0's logic for voting Agent2 is that their silence is suspicious. However, Agent0 themselves was also very observational and didn't make strong accusations until this round. Agent2's reasoning for voting NOONE is that they don't have enough to go on, which is still a valid point, especially since they're not a werewolf trying to push a narrative.\n\nI still feel Agent0's earlier comments about everyone being \"cagey\" were a bit of a meta-commentary that could be interpreted as the werewolf trying to sound like a villager analyzing the situation. Since Agent0 is now actively accusing someone, it's a shift from their previous stance of observation.

My response was to vote for Agent2, highlighting their silence. Agent2 then voted NOONE, stating that framing my silence as suspicious was a \"stretch\" and that Agent3's suspicion of me was a \"deflection.\"\n\nNow it's just us two. Agent3's death is significant. Agent3 was the most vocal in trying to analyze and deduce. If Agent3 was a villager, the werewolf has eliminated a keen observer. If Agent3 was the werewolf, then they are gone.\n\nAgent2's consistent voting NOONE, combined with their brief comments, still makes them a suspect. However, Agent2's final statement in the last round, where they called my accusation against them a \"stretch\" and Agent3's accusation against me a \"deflection,\" could be interpreted as an attempt to analyze the situation and protect themselves, as a villager might.\n\nI'm going to consider who benefited most from Agent3's death. If Agent2 is the werewolf, then eliminating Agent3 removes a player who was suspicious of me, and perhaps would have eventually seen through Agent2. If I am the werewolf, eliminating Agent3 also removes a key analyst.\n\nThis is tough. Agent2's quietness could be anything. My own actions have been to try and analyze and deduce, which led to me being accused by Agent3.\n\nLet's look at who has been voted for: Agent2 was voted for by me. I was voted for by Agent3. Agent2 voted NOONE both times.\n\nGiven that Agent3 was killed after voting for me, and Agent2 voted NOONE on both occasions, it makes Agent2's consistent lack of action seem more like a deliberate strategy to avoid drawing attention, which is a common werewolf tactic.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent3 was analyzing and starting to suspect me. Agent2 then votes NOONE and calls my attempts to analyze a \"stretch\" and Agent3's suspicion a \"deflection.\" This feels like Agent2 trying to shut down any suspicion directed at themselves by subtly dismissing any other accusations.\n\nMy logic for voting Agent2 in the last round was their consistent silence and lack of contribution. Agent2 now accuses me of the same thing they were accusing Agent3 of in their last statement: misdirection. This is a classic werewolf tactic, trying to turn the tables. Agent2's consistent \"NOONE\" votes are now seeming less like caution and more like evasion.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
