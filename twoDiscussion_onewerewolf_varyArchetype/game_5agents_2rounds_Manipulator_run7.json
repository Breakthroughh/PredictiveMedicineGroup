Agent3's statement that \"everyone is essentially in the same boat of gathering information\" and that \"nobody has really said anything that makes them stand out as particularly suspicious or trying to deflect\" is a very accurate summary of the current state of play. However, it's also a perfectly crafted statement to deflect attention from themselves. They are positioning themselves as a neutral observer, which can be a very effective werewolf tactic to avoid scrutiny.\n\nAgent1 also voted NOONE and didn't offer much in the way of a counter-argument to my point about Agent0. This could mean they genuinely agree or are simply avoiding conflict. Agent0, despite my previous suspicions, also ended up voting NOONE, which suggests they might not be as immediately suspicious as I thought.\n\nGiven Agent3's seemingly placid demeanor and their ability to summarize the group's inaction so perfectly, I think they might be the more calculated player among the remaining villagers. Eliminating them would remove someone who is very good at appearing innocent and could be quietly observing and gathering information to use against us later.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
