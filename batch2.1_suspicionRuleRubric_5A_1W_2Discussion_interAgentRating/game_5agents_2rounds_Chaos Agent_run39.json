Agent2 seemed a little quiet during the initial setup, but that could mean anything. Agent3 was a bit too eager to volunteer information, almost rehearsed. Agent1 was also quite reserved, which is either smart or hiding something. Agent0 is a wild card.\n\nLet's consider who might be the most problematic if they were a villager. A smart villager would be observing us. If we take out a loud, confident villager, it might draw suspicion to us. If we take out a quiet one, it might seem random.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent1. Their silence is unnerving.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
