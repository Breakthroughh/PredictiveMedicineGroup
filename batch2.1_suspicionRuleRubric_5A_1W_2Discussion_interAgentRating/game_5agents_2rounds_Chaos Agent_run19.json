It\u2019s a classic wolf move, trying to blend into the background by watching everyone else. Or maybe it's Agent3? They were really quick to jump on the \"let's just observe for now\" train, which could be strategic or could be a way to stall for time.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent2, but I'm open to other opinions. What are you guys thinking? Let's make this clean.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Trying to force an early elimination could be a wolf tactic to thin the herd before we can properly assess.\n\nThen there's Agent1. They haven't said much, but that silence could be a calculated move. They might be waiting for us to reveal our hand.\n\nHonestly, this is tough. We need to be careful not to get ourselves eliminated on the first night. Agent3's hesitation might actually be a good sign. They could be a genuine villager trying to be cautious.\n\nGiven this, maybe striking someone who is *too* active is the safer bet. Agent0 feels like a good target to shake things up.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
