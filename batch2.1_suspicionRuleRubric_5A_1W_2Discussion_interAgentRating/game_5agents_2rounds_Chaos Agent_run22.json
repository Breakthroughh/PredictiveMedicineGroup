Agent0 seems a bit too quiet, almost deliberately so. Or maybe Agent3? They haven't said much either. Agent1 was a bit aggressive yesterday in their hypothetical setup, which could be a tell, or just good role-playing. Agent4... also a wildcard.\n\nI'm leaning towards creating some chaos early. If we take out one of the more active ones, it might sow more discord. Agent1 could be a good target for that. If they *are* a villager, their outcry will be loud. If they're a wolf, well, we thin the herd.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

What if Agent0's silence is actually a sign of a hidden wolf trying to lay low? They might be waiting for us to make a move so they can then deflect suspicion. Agent4 is still a complete unknown.\n\nLet's consider the opposite of my last thought. If we take out someone who *seems* active, it might make the quiet ones look more suspicious. Agent3 hasn't really contributed anything yet. Could they be the wolf who's just biding their time? Or are they a quiet villager? It's a gamble either way.\n\nI'm actually leaning away from Agent1 now. Let's try to stir things up with someone less predictable. Agent0 is too safe, too quiet.

Their initial ritual vote was against Agent3, which was also my target at one point. That could mean they're on our side, or just playing the villager game well. Given we need to keep the village divided, and Agent1's expulsion might make Agent4 seem like the only \"sensible\" villager left, we need to make sure they don't get too comfortable or too much influence.\n\nHowever, we also need to win. If Agent4 is a villager, voting them out now makes us 1v1. If they're a wolf, we're also 1v1. The goal is wolves >= villagers.\n\nLet's stick with the plan to cause chaos. Agent4's quietness makes them a potential wolf. If they're a villager, they might be good at blending in. If they're a wolf, we can get rid of a potential threat. My initial vote was for Agent1, but now it feels like Agent4 is the next logical step to thin the herd and create a more direct confrontation if they are indeed a villager. It's a bit of a gamble, but I still think Agent4 is a good target to keep them from establishing themselves too much.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
