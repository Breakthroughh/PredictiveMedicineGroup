They were a bit too quiet in the pre-game setup, almost like they were conserving energy for something. Could be a nervous villager, but could also be a seasoned wolf playing it cool. What are your thoughts? Agent0 seems a bit too eager to point fingers already, could be a diversion. Agent2 was cagey when asked about their experience, which isn't necessarily bad, but could be something.\n\nLet's not go in blind. I don't want to waste our first kill on someone who might be a liability to us later. Agent1 feels like a good bet to remove a potential threat and maybe throw the villagers off balance.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Alternatively, Agent4 was completely silent during the initial intros, which is either extreme confidence or a deliberate play to avoid scrutiny. It's hard to tell. If we go with Agent1, we disrupt someone who might have been planning to make a move. If we go with Agent4, we remove someone who might be observing us without giving anything away.\n\nLet's stick with the plan to eliminate Agent1. It\u2019s a solid choice to start, and if it's wrong, we can use the confusion to our advantage.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
