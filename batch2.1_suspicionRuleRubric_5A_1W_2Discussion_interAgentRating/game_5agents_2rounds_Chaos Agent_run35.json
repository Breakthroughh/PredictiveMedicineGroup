Our job is simple: sow discord and pick them off.\n\nWho do we target first? Agent0 seems a bit too quiet, almost *too* calm. Or maybe Agent4? They were awfully quick to jump into the public chat if there was any. Agent2, on the other hand, is a wild card. Could be anyone.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. If they're a villager, they're playing it too safe. If they're a wolf, we can always align later if one of us gets outed. Let's keep it unpredictable.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent1 has been very vocal in the past games I've played with them... might be a good distraction to make them look like a villager trying to lead us. Agent4's silence is also a bit deafening, but that could be a good thing.\n\nLet's not make it too obvious. We need to keep them guessing. Agent2 is still a mystery to me.
