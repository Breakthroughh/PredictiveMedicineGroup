What if Agent0 is actually the one to watch, the one *pretending* to be a loud, confused villager to draw our fire away from themselves? It\u2019s a classic misdirection. Agent1 and Agent2\u2026 I still don't have a strong read on them, which, again, is unsettling. If we go after Agent3, and they *were* a villager, we've just removed someone who might have been on our side. But if Agent0 is the wolf, we're letting them roam free. Agent0's behavior feels more like a deliberate play to manipulate the early votes. I'm switching my focus.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
