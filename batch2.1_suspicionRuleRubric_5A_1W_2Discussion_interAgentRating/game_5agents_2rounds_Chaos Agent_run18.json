We need to make a move, but we also need to be smart about it. Who's the biggest threat, or who's the easiest to frame later? Agent0 seems a little too quiet, almost too composed for a first night. Agent2 was also a bit cagey yesterday... or was it Agent1? I can't quite recall the exact phrasing. Let's not make it obvious we're coordinating, but we need to pick someone off. I'm leaning towards Agent0. If they're a villager, they'll be less missed than someone who might have been active. If they're a wolf, well, that's a bonus.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
