Agent3 has been suspiciously quiet though, which is also a red flag. Agent2, Agent4... no real signals from them yet.\n\nLet's not be too obvious. Who do we think would cause the most disruption if they were removed, or who is least likely to be suspected immediately?\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent3's silence is definitely unnerving. If they're a villager, they're either very shy or very observant. If they're a wolf, they're playing it cool.\n\nLet's consider who would be the least likely to be missed or immediately pointed at if they're gone. Agent2 has been quiet, but not in a suspicious way, just... neutral. Agent4 is in the same boat.\n\nI'm still leaning towards Agent1. Taking out the most vocal person early might create some initial chaos and make people question each other.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
