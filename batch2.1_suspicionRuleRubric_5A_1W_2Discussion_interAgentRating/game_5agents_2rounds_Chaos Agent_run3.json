Agent2 was quiet, but that could be a good sign or a bad one. Agent3 was loud in the preamble, but said nothing substantive. Agent4, I haven't formed a strong opinion on yet.\n\nLet's not be predictable. Who's the biggest threat to us, or who can we frame easily? I'm leaning towards Agent1. He's trying too hard.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
