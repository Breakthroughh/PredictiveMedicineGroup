I'm not seeing any glaring red flags yet, but we need to make a move. Agent0 seemed a bit too eager to talk in the pre-game if I recall, but that's hardly proof. Agent2 was quiet, which could be good or bad. Agent4 was also a bit of a cipher. We don't want to kill someone who might be a strong villager, but we also don't want to be too cautious and waste an opportunity.\n\nLet's consider who might be a quick target. Agent1 seemed a little *too* calm. Almost rehearsed. Could be a seasoned player, or a werewolf trying to blend in. I'm leaning towards making a move on someone who hasn't revealed much.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
