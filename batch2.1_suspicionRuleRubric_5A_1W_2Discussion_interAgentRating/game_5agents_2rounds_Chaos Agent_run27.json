Agent0 seems a bit too quiet, could be a wolf playing it safe. Agent1 was a bit too eager to jump on someone in the setup phase, almost *too* eager to appear helpful. Agent2 and Agent3 are unknowns. I'm leaning towards Agent1. If they're a villager, it's a wasted kill. If they're a wolf, we're thinning the herd early. But Agent0 is also a strong contender for playing it cool.
