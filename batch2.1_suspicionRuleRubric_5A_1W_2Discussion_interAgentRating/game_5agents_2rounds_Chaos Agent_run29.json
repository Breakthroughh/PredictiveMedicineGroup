Agent0 seemed a bit too eager to push for a vote on Agent3 in the limited pre-game info we got. Could be a trap, could be them being genuinely suspicious. Agent1 was quiet, which is usually good for us, but it also means they might be a clever villager. Agent4... honestly, I have no read on them yet.\n\nMy gut feeling? Let's take out Agent0. They're the most vocal, the most likely to get a solid villager narrative going. If we eliminate them early, it throws a wrench in their plans.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
