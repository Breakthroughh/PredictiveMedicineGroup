Agent4's eagerness could be a double-edged sword \u2013 maybe they're trying to get us to kill someone they suspect, or maybe they're just enthusiastic. What about Agent2? They were very quiet during the pre-game. Could that be strategic silence, or just a reserved personality? It's hard to tell without any daytime discussion. I'm going to stick with my initial gut feeling for now, but I'm open to other ideas if anyone else has a strong one.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
