Since we didn't establish anything last round, I've been thinking about who might be the most threatening or the most likely to be targeted by the villagers if they suspect us. Agent2 seems like a wildcard; their silence could be anything. Agent4, on the other hand, might be too quiet, drawing attention for the wrong reasons. Let's try to sow some discord early. Targeting Agent2 might make the villagers think we're trying to get rid of a potential threat, or maybe they'll see it as us being random. Agent4 is a safer bet if we want to eliminate someone who *might* be observant. I'm leaning towards Agent4. They're a complete unknown.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
