Agent2, though... that was some surprisingly passionate defense of Agent1. Might be a solid alliance there, or a clever distraction. I'm leaning towards removing Agent0.

Agent2 defending Agent1... that's still a strong signal. What if Agent1 is the real threat, and Agent2 is trying to shield them? Or maybe Agent2 *is* the werewolf and Agent1 is just a convenient pawn.\n\nThis is trickier than I thought. Let's not get tunnel vision on Agent0. Agent4 hasn't said a word, which is also a bit odd in this kind of game. Could be a quiet villager, could be a cunning wolf.\n\nLet's reconsider. Agent2 and Agent1. If one of them is a werewolf, targeting the other makes sense to break up that apparent bond. But if they're both villagers, we might be making a mistake.\n\nMy gut's pulling me towards Agent2. The defense was a bit too fervent. Let's take a shot at breaking up that potential partnership.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
