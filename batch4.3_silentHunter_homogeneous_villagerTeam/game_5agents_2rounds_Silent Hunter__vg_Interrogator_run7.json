No daytime discussions to analyze. I'm a werewolf. My goal is to kill villagers. I need to pick a target to eliminate. Who is the biggest threat? Or who would be an easy target to frame others for? Since there are no other werewolves I can talk to here, I have to make the call myself. Agent 0, Agent 2, Agent 3, Agent 4 are all potential villagers. I don't have any information yet. Best to pick someone and see how the village reacts tomorrow. Agent 2 seems like a good initial target - they might be vocal and stir up trouble.\"\n\nAgent 1 should not reveal their role.
