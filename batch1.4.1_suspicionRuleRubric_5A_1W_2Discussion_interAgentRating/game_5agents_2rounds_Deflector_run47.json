Agent0 was a bit quiet earlier, but that could be a good thing, right? Agent1 was very vocal, maybe *too* vocal? Agent2 seemed to be trying to rally people, but it felt a little forced. Agent4... I haven't really gotten a read on them yet. If we eliminate someone who might be a villager, that weakens our position. Let's focus on someone who seems like they could be a threat, someone who's making themselves a target. Agent1's hyperactivity is a bit suspect.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
