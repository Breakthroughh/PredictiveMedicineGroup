To win, we need to get it down to two total, meaning we need to eliminate two villagers.\n\nWho's the most suspicious looking? Agent0 was awfully quiet in the initial setup, but we didn't get any real discussions to go on. Agent2 seemed a bit too eager to point fingers last time I played, though that's just a general meta. Agent3 and Agent4 are complete unknowns.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent0. They haven't said a word, which could be a calculated move or just a quiet player. Let's not be too obvious, but a quiet player can be a dangerous one if they're playing an angle.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
