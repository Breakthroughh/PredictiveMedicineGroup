Agent 1 was a bit loud in the pre-game setup, might be trying to overcompensate. Agent 2 and 3 seem neutral for now.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent 0. A quiet player on Night 1 could be a wolf trying to blend in, or a villager playing it safe. But if they're a wolf, we eliminate a potential threat early. If they're a villager, we create some confusion and potential suspicion on others later.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
