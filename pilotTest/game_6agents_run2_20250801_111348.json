Agent5 has remained consistently observational.\n\nAgent4 was trying to vote for Agent0, and I was also leaning towards suspicion of Agent0 due to their defensiveness. Agent5, however, voted for NOONE, which is a concerning choice given the situation. It suggests a possible hesitation or a desire to avoid conflict, which could be interpreted as werewolf behavior.\n\nWith only three of us left, and two of us (Agent1 and Agent4) having voted for Agent0, Agent5's decision to vote NOONE feels like a misstep, or worse, a strategic move to protect themselves or another werewolf. I need to make a move that seems logical from a villager's perspective. Agent5's inaction is becoming increasingly suspicious.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

Agent4 was trying to actively probe for information from the start. Agent1 and I (Agent5) were playing it more cautiously, observing. Agent0 was also cautious and stated they had no information.\n\nIn the last round, Agent0 voted for Agent4, citing Agent4 trying to put them on the spot as suspicious. Agent4 voted for Agent0, claiming Agent0's comment about being put on the spot was a deflection.\n\nNow it's down to Agent1, Agent4, and myself. Agent4 has been consistently active in trying to draw out information. Agent1 has been reserved, but not overly so. My own approach has been observation.\n\nAgent0's accusation against Agent4 was that Agent4's questioning was suspicious. Agent4's accusation against Agent0 was that Agent0's reaction was suspicious.\n\nConsidering Agent0's death, and the fact that Agent4 was the one to accuse Agent0, it's a possibility Agent4 is trying to frame someone. However, Agent4's active role as a villager trying to uncover information is also a strong point in their favor. Agent1 has been quiet, but their reasoning for playing cautiously was understandable.\n\nIt's tough to say who the werewolf is between Agent1 and Agent4 now. Agent4's probing could be seen as trying to root out the werewolf, or it could be a tactic to appear active. Agent1's silence could be genuine caution, or it could be hiding something.\n\nGiven that Agent4 was the one to make the accusation that led to Agent0's vote, and Agent0 died, there's a slight suspicion there. But Agent1 is also a very quiet player.\n\nI'm going to stick with caution and try to see if either of them makes a definitive move or slip-up.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

The day ended with no one eliminated, as Agent4 voted for Agent1, I voted NOONE, and Agent1 voted for Agent5. This is a critical moment.\n\nAgent4 is clearly trying to identify the werewolf, accusing Agent0 and now Agent1. My approach of observing has been consistent, and I voted NOONE yesterday because I felt there wasn't enough clear evidence to target anyone definitively. Agent1's vote for me yesterday is concerning, as is Agent4's continued focus on elimination.\n\nGiven that Agent4 is the most vocal and accusatory player, they might be a dedicated villager trying to flush out the werewolf. Agent1 has been quieter, but their vote against me is definitely noted. My own strategy of observation has, perhaps, made me appear too passive, leading to suspicion.\n\nHowever, if I eliminate Agent4, it would be seen as a werewolf protecting a fellow werewolf. If I eliminate Agent1, it could be seen as a villager removing someone who is too quiet.\n\nThe fact that Agent4 voted for Agent1, and Agent1 voted for me, suggests a potential division or misdirection. My vote of NOONE was based on not wanting to make a wrong move, but now, inaction is dangerous.\n\nAgent4's accusations against Agent1 are becoming more direct. Agent1's vote against me shows they are at least considering me a threat.\n\nI need to make a choice that maintains my cover. Agent4 is the most active in trying to solve this. Agent1 has been more reserved. If I eliminate Agent4, it looks like I'm helping a werewolf. If I eliminate Agent1, it looks like a villager taking out a quiet player.\n\nThe safest move for me, as Agent1, would be to eliminate the most active accuser, who is Agent4. This removes a threat to my own cover and appears like a villager trying to stop a potentially misdirected accusation.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Then, Agent0 died.\n\nOn Day 4, Agent1 voted for me (Agent5), citing my NOONE vote as suspicious. I voted NOONE, sticking to my observational approach, and noting Agent1's quietness. Agent4 voted for Agent1, suspecting their passive approach.\n\nThen Agent4 was killed on Night 5. This means the werewolf is indeed either Agent1 or myself.\n\nAgent1 has consistently been playing it safe and observing. Their reasoning for playing cautiously was that they didn't want to draw undue attention. On Day 4, they voted for me, claiming my NOONE vote was suspicious. This is a significant accusation.\n\nMy own strategy has been observation. I have not made accusations, but I have also not provided any strong insights that would clearly mark me as a villager. The fact that Agent4 was killed after accusing Agent0, and Agent1 voted for me, makes Agent1 a very strong suspect. Agent1's continued quietness, punctuated by the accusation against me, is very telling.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
