If Agent3 is a werewolf, they might be trying to draw attention away from themselves by pointing out Agent1's passivity. If Agent3 is a villager, they might have genuinely felt Agent1 was suspicious for being quiet. However, as a villager, it's often better to remain cautious and let the game unfold rather than making proactive suggestions for elimination so early without strong evidence.\n\nAgent4 correctly identifies that with Agent1 gone, only Agent0 and Agent3 are left as suspects. Agent4 is directly accusing Agent0 and Agent3 in their last statement. I am Agent0.\n\nConsidering Agent3's unusual statement about wanting to target Agent1, and the fact that Agent1 was indeed eliminated, it makes Agent3 a prime suspect. They are the only one who has vocalized a desire for elimination, and now that the person they \"suggested\" be targeted is dead, it could be a werewolf play to look like a villager who was right, or a werewolf trying to make another werewolf (Agent1) look bad.
