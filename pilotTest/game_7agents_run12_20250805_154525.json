Agent5 was actively trying to engage and analyze, which makes their death particularly worrying. Agent6 voted for Agent2 yesterday, and Agent3 also voted for Agent2. Agent2 voted for Agent6. I voted NOONE, still trying to gather information.\n\nYesterday's discussion:\nAgent5 pointed suspicion at Agent6 for voting for Agent0.\nAgent3 voted for Agent2, saying Agent6's read was worth considering, but didn't want to be obvious. This is a bit contradictory, voting for Agent2 while acknowledging Agent6's read on Agent0.\nAgent6 asked about deflection and observation, implying others weren't doing enough.\nAgent2 leaned towards Agent6 due to their prior vote on Agent0, and Agent6's comments.\n\nThe fact that Agent2 and Agent3 both voted for Agent2, and Agent2 voted for Agent6, means there's a lot of cross-accusation happening. Agent6's strategy of voting for Agent0 initially could have been a genuine guess, or a way to get Agent0 killed and then look innocent. The fact that Agent0 *was* killed might make Agent6 look prescient, or it might be a lucky coincidence.\n\nAgent5 was killed last night, and they were actively investigating. Agent6's previous vote on Agent0, and now Agent2 and Agent3 voting for each other, creates a lot of noise. Agent2 seems to be basing their vote on Agent6's previous vote on Agent0, which is a bit of a leap. Agent3's logic was also a bit convoluted.\n\nGiven the deaths, and the lack of clear werewolf tells, I still feel like NOONE is the safest bet to avoid revealing myself, but I need to try and break this deadlock. Agent6's initial vote on Agent0 could be a misdirection or a genuine guess that the werewolf acted on. However, the fact that Agent2 and Agent3 are now accusing each other, and Agent2 also pointed at Agent6, makes me suspicious of the group dynamic.\n\nLet's re-evaluate: Agent6 initiated the \"accusation\" phase by voting for Agent0. Agent5 called that out. Agent2 and Agent3 then focused on each other, with Agent2 also mentioning Agent6. Agent5 was killed.\n\nI am leaning towards Agent2 or Agent3 being the werewolf.

Agent2, you\u2019ve been very quiet, which is what Agent5 pointed out as potentially suspicious. Agent6, you were also calling out Agent2 for being quiet. Agent5 was killed, and they were vocal about their suspicions. Agent6, you seem to be trying to point fingers, but your own voting record is a bit erratic. Agent3, your vote for Agent2, who has been silent, could be a genuine suspicion, or it could be a misdirection. I'm still trying to make sense of who is genuinely investigating and who is trying to manipulate.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

Agent6's initial vote for Agent0 was interesting, but Agent0 got killed anyway. Agent2's focus on Agent6 might be a deflection. Agent3's vote for Agent2 felt a bit off, given the lack of concrete evidence.\n\nGiven the current accusations, Agent2 seems to be the most vocal about others while also being accused.

Agent1, you've been consistently quiet, which can be a sign of either careful observation or hidden intentions. Given that Agent6 was voted for by both Agent2 and Agent3 yesterday, and Agent2 is now dead, it's likely Agent6 is not the werewolf. Agent3, your vote for Agent2 yesterday was based on Agent6's read, but your reasoning was a bit shaky.\n\nWith only three of us left, it's crucial we make the right choice. Agent6 has been vocal and has been a consistent target for others' votes. Agent1 has remained largely out of the fray. I'm going to consider Agent1's consistent silence as a potential indicator of their role.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Yesterday, Agent2 and Agent3 voted for each other, and Agent6 voted for Agent2. I voted for Agent2. It seems the majority was indeed looking at Agent2, and the werewolf acted to prevent Agent2's elimination.\n\nLet's recap the last day's votes:\nAgent1 voted: Agent2\nAgent6 voted: Agent2\nAgent3 voted: Agent2\nAgent2 voted: Agent6\n\nSo, on Day 3, Agent2 was the majority vote, but they were killed overnight. This means the werewolf is either Agent6 or Agent3.\n\nNow, it's just us three. Agent6, you were the one pointing out people were quiet, and then voting for Agent2. Agent3, you also voted for Agent2, and mentioned Agent6's earlier vote on Agent0 being a \"good read\" but then voted for Agent2.\n\nIf Agent6 were the werewolf, voting for Agent2 would make sense to draw suspicion away from themselves, and then the werewolf would kill Agent2.\nIf Agent3 were the werewolf, voting for Agent2 also makes sense to draw suspicion away from themselves, and then the werewolf would kill Agent2.\n\nHowever, Agent3's reasoning yesterday was a bit contradictory. They said Agent6's read on Agent0 was a \"good read\" but then voted for Agent2. This might imply they thought Agent6 was onto something, but then decided to target Agent2 for other reasons, or to deflect.\n\nAgent6's constant probing and calling out of quiet players could be genuine investigation, or it could be an attempt to force others to reveal themselves or make mistakes. Agent6 also voted for Agent2 yesterday.\n\nGiven that Agent2 was the target of the majority yesterday, and was killed overnight, the werewolf is definitely one of the remaining two. Agent6's vote for Agent2 is suspicious in hindsight, as is Agent3's vote for Agent2. Agent3's statement about Agent6's \"good read\" on Agent0 is also a curious detail.\n\nI need to make a choice. Agent6's behavior has been consistently more vocal and probing. Agent3 has been more reserved, with some slightly convoluted reasoning. If I vote for Agent6, and Agent3 votes for Agent6, Agent6 is eliminated. If Agent6 is the werewolf, that wins it for us. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they would then vote for me, and then Agent6 would be left to vote for me or Agent3.\n\nLet's consider who has benefited the most from the deaths. Agent4 was killed early. Agent0, who was trying to investigate, was killed. Agent5, who was actively analyzing, was killed. Agent2, who was the target of the majority, was killed.\n\nI am still trying to parse the logic. Agent3 said Agent6's read on Agent0 was a \"good read\". This is key. If Agent3 genuinely believed Agent6 was onto something about Agent0, and then voted for Agent2, it suggests Agent3 wasn't entirely aligned with Agent6's investigation.\n\nI'm going to trust my gut feeling from yesterday. Agent3's reasoning felt a little too constructed.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent0 was killed Night 2.\nDay 2: Agent6 voted for Agent2. Agent5 voted for Agent6. Agent3 voted for Agent2. Agent1 voted NOONE. Agent0 was killed.\nDay 3: Agent6 voted for Agent2. Agent3 voted for Agent2. Agent2 voted for Agent6. Agent1 voted NOONE. Agent5 was killed.\nDay 4: Agent2 was killed.\n\nThis means the werewolf must be Agent1 or Agent3. Agent6 (me) has been trying to draw out the werewolf and has made some calculated votes. Agent2's death last night is significant. They were leaning towards Agent6. Agent5 was also leaning towards Agent6. Agent3 voted for Agent2.\n\nGiven Agent2 was killed, and they were accusing Agent6 (me), it's possible the werewolf is Agent3, who then killed Agent2 to silence them or make Agent6 look guilty. Alternatively, Agent1 could be the werewolf and has been playing very conservatively, letting others accuse each other.\n\nAgent3, you voted for Agent2 consistently. Agent1, you've been quiet, which could be strategic. I need to decide who to trust. If Agent3 is the werewolf, their consistent voting for Agent2 could be a play to either get Agent2 (a potential threat) killed, or to appear as a villager trying to find the werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
