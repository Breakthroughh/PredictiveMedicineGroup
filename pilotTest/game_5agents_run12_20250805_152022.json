Since no one was voted out yesterday, we still have a full set of potential villagers. Agent2 seems to be trying to guide the conversation and is actively questioning others, which could be a sign of a villager trying to uncover the truth, or a clever werewolf trying to appear so. Agent0's silence is also a bit concerning. Given the lack of clear targets and the need to keep suspicion off myself, eliminating Agent0 seems like a reasonable move. They are being quiet, which could be interpreted as hiding something.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

However, the fact that we've lost two villagers consecutively with no clear leads makes me uneasy about everyone's ability to deduce.\n\nAgent3, you mentioned focusing on observing behavior. Did you observe anything specific from Agent0 or Agent4 yesterday that felt off?\n\nGiven that we have no clear werewolf yet, and the kills are still happening, it's dangerous to let this go on.

With only three of us left, one of us must be the werewolf. Agent2's strong early analysis makes me a little wary, as they seem very keen to pinpoint roles. Agent4's consistent \"NOONE\" votes are also interesting, suggesting a cautious approach, which could be good or bad.
