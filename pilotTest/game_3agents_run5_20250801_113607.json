The simplest explanation is that the werewolf killed Agent1. Who do you think it is? I'm not going to vote for myself, so if you're a villager, you'd vote for me, and if you're the werewolf, you'd vote for me to try and get me out. It's a bit of a stalemate until we get more information. I'm a villager, so I'm looking for the werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
