Agent0 seems to be playing it safe by not accusing anyone. Agent2 also voted no one, which is a bit passive.\n\nAgent4's vote for NOONE last night felt a little weak.

Agent2 also voted NOONE, which makes me wonder if they are trying to avoid making a commitment or if they genuinely have no suspicions. Given that no one was eliminated, it's important we don't get caught being too passive. Agent0 is also being very quiet.\n\nI think we should target Agent2. They voted NOONE, which didn't help us make progress. If they are a villager, they are being too cautious. If they are a werewolf, they are trying to avoid detection, but their lack of contribution is becoming suspicious.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
