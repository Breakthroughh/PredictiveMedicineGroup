Agent2's suspicion of you is noted. Agent3 and Agent0 are still taking a \"wait and see\" approach, which is understandable, but we're running out of time.

However, it's also important not to draw too much attention to ourselves. Agent6's observation that \"Agent1 specifically asked everyone for their thoughts, which is good\" and then following up with \"I'm still in observation mode\" is consistent with being a cautious villager. Agent7 is also still observing and looking for reactions. Agent3 remains quiet and observational.\n\nI'm not going to make a move that will immediately draw suspicion to myself.

Agent7 is still observant, Agent3 is quiet, Agent4 hasn't expressed strong suspicions. My initial vote for Agent5, then Agent1, then Agent2 has been consistent with trying to eliminate proactive players.\n\nAgent7's earlier comment about werewolves picking off good detectives still resonates. Agent3 has been consistently quiet, which can be a sign of a villager trying to observe, or a werewolf playing it safe. Agent4 has also been relatively quiet.\n\nTo keep up the momentum and eliminate a potentially useful villager, I think Agent7's continued emphasis on observing and analyzing makes them a good target to remove.

Agent0 did mention that \"It seems the werewolves are picking off anyone who shows signs of being a good investigator or a leader,\" which is a good observation, but they haven't made a move. Agent4 also noted the pattern of eliminations.\n\nIt's hard to tell who is who at this point.

Agent4's consistent lack of strong opinions might also be a tell, or simply a sign of a very cautious villager.\n\nIf I, as a werewolf, want to win, I need to eliminate the remaining villagers. Between Agent3 and Agent4, there isn't a clear indication of who is more dangerous.

Agent4 has also been quiet but has acknowledged Agent2's suspicion of Agent6.\n\nI think Agent3's consistent quietness might be the more strategic play to avoid suspicion.
