Agent1's call to \"get a read on everyone else's initial reactions\" and Agent0's focus on the werewolf striking early are valid points. Agent4 also wants to piece things together. Given that, Agent1 seems to be trying to foster discussion and understand everyone's perspective, which feels like a villager trying to find the killer. Agent0 is also actively trying to figure things out. Agent4 asked open-ended questions. I'll target Agent1. They are being quite vocal and trying to get everyone to reveal their thoughts, which could be a tactic to draw out suspicion or to genuinely understand the situation.

With Agent1 out, it feels like we're losing people who are trying to figure things out. I'm still suspicious of everyone, as we have no solid leads. My vote for Agent1 last night was to stir the pot and see who would react. Now, with only three of us left, it's crucial we make the right choice. Agent0's insistence on the werewolf being active and Agent4's desire to understand makes it hard to point fingers directly.
