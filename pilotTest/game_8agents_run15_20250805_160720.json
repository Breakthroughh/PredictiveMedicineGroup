Agent1, you voted for Agent5 yesterday, and now Agent5 is dead. That's a strong indicator. Your reasoning was that Agent5's lack of input made them wary, and that voting NOONE was a safe bet. Yet, you then voted for them. Agent5 also voted NOONE yesterday, which you noted as a safe bet. It's quite the coincidence. Agent4 also voted for Agent1 yesterday, calling their initial placeholder vote \"arbitrary\" and an \"attempt to deflect suspicion.\" I agree with Agent4's assessment of Agent1's early vote.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
