Agent5 asked Agent6 for thoughts, which is fine. Agent1 is playing it safe by listening. Agent4 is also being cautious. Agent3 is calling for more information.\n\nMy initial vote for Agent5 yesterday was just a guess, as we had no information. Now, looking at the discussion, Agent6 is being very proactive in trying to figure things out, which could be a sign of a villager trying to lead. However, they also asked Agent7 to report, which is a bit pointed. Agent0's suspicion of everyone not targeted is a classic villager move.\n\nI think we need to eliminate someone who is starting to ask too many questions or seems too eager to analyze. Agent6 is doing a lot of the talking and trying to direct the conversation. If they are a werewolf, they're playing it a bit too strongly. If they're a villager, they might be a valuable target for the werewolves to remove. I'm going to vote for Agent6 tonight.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",
