      "content": "Agent3 is gone. Agent4 is dead. We are down to Agent0, Agent1, and myself (Agent6).\n\nLet's recap the votes from Day 2:\nAgent1 voted for Agent3.\nAgent3 voted for Agent4.\nAgent6 voted for Agent3.\nAgent4 voted for Agent3.\nAgent0 voted for Agent3.\n\nThe majority correctly identified Agent3 as a target, which is good. However, Agent3 was killed last night, not by our vote. This means the werewolf is still among us and killed Agent4.\n\nAgent1, you voted for Agent3 yesterday. Agent0, you also voted for Agent3. I also voted for Agent3. Agent3, as you know, voted for Agent4.\n\nNow Agent4 is dead. Agent3 was voted out yesterday, but the werewolf killed Agent4 last night. This implies the werewolf didn't want Agent3 to be further investigated or perhaps wanted to eliminate Agent4 for their vote against Agent3.\n\nAgent1, you are still advocating for caution and observation. Agent0, you've been fairly quiet, mostly asking questions.\n\nWho benefited from Agent4's death? Agent3 was already out of the picture by vote. The werewolf killed Agent4, who voted for Agent3. This could mean the werewolf is protecting someone who was allied with Agent3, or trying to silence someone who was correctly identifying a potential threat. Or, it could be a misdirection.\n\nGiven that Agent0 and Agent1 both voted NOONE on Day 1, and Agent0 consistently voted NOONE on Day 2 (before the majority formed on Agent3), they seem to be playing a more passive role. Agent1 has been vocal about observation. Agent0 hasn't offered much in terms of personal suspicion, but has asked probing questions.\n\nThe werewolf killed Agent4 last night. Agent4 voted for Agent3. If the werewolf was trying to protect Agent3, then that strategy failed as Agent3 was already targeted by the majority. Killing Agent4 after Agent4 voted for Agent3 is confusing.\n\nI'm starting to suspect the one who hasn't been consistently voting for others or being voted for themselves. Agent0 has been quite passive. Agent1 has been consistent in their cautious approach.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
