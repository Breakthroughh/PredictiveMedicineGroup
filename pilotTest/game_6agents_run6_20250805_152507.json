Agent0's persistent NOONE votes are making me wary. They haven't offered any real analysis, just general statements. Agent4's vote for Agent5 is also noteworthy, as it suggests they might have some suspicion there. Agent5, in turn, voted for me, perhaps to counter my earlier accusation of them.\n\nWe need to make a decisive move. Agent0's passive approach feels like a potential cover.
