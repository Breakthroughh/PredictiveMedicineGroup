That feels like a strong indicator that the werewolf wanted to silence someone who was starting to suspect them, or at least someone who was willing to take a risk. Agent8 was actively trying to deduce, and now they're dead.\n\nAgent3 was also quite active yesterday, questioning a lot of people. Agent7 was asking questions and then voted for Agent2. Agent2 was quiet initially but was asked a direct question by Agent7. Agent3 even called Agent2's silence \"interesting.\"\n\nGiven that Agent8 was killed after voting, I'm leaning towards someone who felt threatened by that vote. Agent0 was voted for, but Agent0 remained silent and didn't vote, which could be a strategy to lay low.\n\nLet's look at the votes from yesterday. Agent8 voted for Agent0. Agent7 voted for Agent2. Agent3 voted for Agent2. Agent2 voted NOONE. Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent1 voted NOONE. Agent6 voted NOONE. Agent5 (myself) voted NOONE.\n\nThe fact that Agent8, who was killed, was the only one to vote for a specific person (Agent0) yesterday, and that person was Agent0, makes me suspicious of Agent0. However, Agent0's silence yesterday could also be a calculated move to avoid suspicion.\n\nAgent7 and Agent3 both voted for Agent2. If Agent2 were the werewolf, it would make sense for Agent8 to be killed for pointing a finger at Agent0, and then for Agent7 and Agent3 to try and eliminate Agent2.\n\nBut Agent8's death feels more directly linked to their action yesterday. They specifically targeted Agent0. If Agent0 is the wolf, killing Agent8 makes sense. If someone else is the wolf and wanted to prevent Agent8 from finding out, they might have killed Agent8 too.\n\nThis is tricky. The two deaths are in different ways. Agent4 first night, then Agent8 last night.\n\nLet's consider Agent3. They were very vocal yesterday and tried to analyze everyone. They even accused Agent2 of being \"too eager to point fingers\" and Agent2 of being \"too quiet.\" That's a lot of commentary. They also voted for Agent2.\n\nIf I have to pick someone to remove to uncover the truth, and Agent8's death seems linked to their vote, I'm going to consider Agent0.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
