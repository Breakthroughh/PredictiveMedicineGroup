Agent3, however, is still hesitant and called out Agent0's vote on Agent6 as premature. Agent1 is also focusing on who benefits from Agent0's death and who was trying to shut down inquiry. Agent7 is clearly suspicious of Agent6 because of Agent0's vote. My previous vote for Agent4 was a strategic move to keep attention away from me, and it seems to have worked as it didn't lead to a kill.\n\nWith Agent0 gone, the most vocal investigator is out. Agent6 is currently the most targeted, with Agent1, Agent7, and even Agent8 (who seems to be following the general suspicion) leaning that way. Agent3 is being cautious, and I'll follow that lead. Agent6's consistent \"NOONE\" votes, while seemingly innocent, could also be interpreted as playing it safe to avoid drawing attention, which is a werewolf tactic. However, if the majority is already leaning towards Agent6, it might be better for us to let the village deal with them.\n\nInstead, I think it would be more effective to remove someone who is trying to be a voice of reason or is observing carefully, like Agent3. Agent3's cautious approach, while good for a villager, can also be seen as a way to avoid making a definitive stand, which might be interpreted negatively by others looking for commitment. Eliminating Agent3 could sow more confusion and potentially remove a thoughtful villager who might otherwise piece things together.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent1 voted for Agent6. Agent4 voted NOONE. Agent7 voted for Agent6. Agent2 voted for Agent4.\n\nThe majority vote yesterday was for Agent6, but it didn't reach a majority. The werewolf is clearly trying to eliminate active players who are trying to lead the investigation. Agent0 was killed after pointing at Agent6, and now Agent3 is dead after voting NOONE but having previously questioned Agent6.

Agent6's own vote was for Agent3. Agent6 has been fairly neutral in their commentary. Agent2's vote for Agent4 seems a bit random, as Agent4 has been consistently voting NOONE.\n\nGiven that Agent0 and Agent3, who were both trying to lead the investigation, have been killed, I'm starting to suspect someone who has been relatively quiet or has been trying to divert attention. Agent6 has been the target of multiple votes, but has also been fairly consistent in their voting pattern.\n\nI'm going to stick with my earlier suspicion that Agent6 might be the werewolf, as they have been a consistent target of accusations.

This pattern suggests the werewolves are targeting players who are actively trying to investigate or are perceived as potential threats to their operation.\n\nLooking at the remaining players: Agent6 and Agent7 are both suspicious of each other, with Agent7 explicitly voting for Agent6 based on Agent0's previous accusation. Agent1 is also trying to figure out who benefited from Agent0's death. Agent8 seems to be going along with the majority suspicion of Agent6. My own vote for Agent4 was a defensive move, and it seemed to work in not getting me killed.\n\nThe village is fractured and suspicious. Agent6 is the primary target for several players. If Agent6 *is* a villager, letting them be lynched would be a mistake. If Agent6 *is* a werewolf, then letting the village take them out is also not ideal for us. However, if we can shift the suspicion, it might be beneficial.\n\nAgent1's focus on \"who benefits\" is a good villager strategy. Agent7's unwavering suspicion of Agent6 is also a strong indicator, but could also be a misdirection.\n\nGiven the current climate, I think it would be strategic to target Agent1.

Now, we are down to Agent1, Agent2, Agent4, and Agent8.\n\nAgent1 has been actively trying to deduce the werewolf and has been vocal about their suspicions. Agent8 has also been vocal, particularly regarding Agent6. Agent4 has been consistently quiet, and Agent2 has been making strategic, but sometimes seemingly random, votes to deflect suspicion.\n\nThe game is now at a critical stage. We need to eliminate the remaining villagers quickly. Agent1's analytical nature makes them a threat. Agent8's consistent focus on Agent6, even after their elimination, could be seen as either genuine deduction or a continued effort to frame someone else. Agent4's silence is the most unnerving, as it's hard to gauge their intentions.\n\nConsidering the remaining players, Agent1 is still the most actively trying to piece things together and could be dangerous if left unchecked. Eliminating Agent1 would remove a strong voice of opposition.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Their focused suspicions on Agent6, and Agent6's eventual elimination, seemed like a strong lead. However, Agent1 was killed after that, suggesting the werewolf is still active and targeting those who are getting close.\n\nWe are now down to Agent2, Agent4, and Agent8. Agent8 has been consistently suspicious of Agent6, which aligns with my own analysis. Agent4 has been very quiet throughout the game, making their intentions hard to gauge. My previous votes have been strategic to eliminate active investigators.\n\nGiven that Agent1 is gone, and the pattern of eliminating investigators continues, it's crucial to identify the remaining threat. Agent8's consistent targeting of Agent6 (who is now eliminated) might be genuine deduction, or a way to divert attention. Agent4's silence is particularly unnerving as it's hard to know if they are genuinely observant or waiting for an opportunity.\n\nIt's difficult to make a definitive choice here without more information. However, Agent8's consistent focus on Agent6, and their reasoning about eliminating investigators, seems to align with a villager's perspective. Agent4's silence, while potentially strategic, also makes them a more unpredictable threat, as their true intentions are unknown.\n\nIn this situation, where the active investigators are being systematically removed, it's often the quiet ones who are the most dangerous.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Agent1 was focused on Agent6, but then their final vote was for Agent6, with Agent2 voting for Agent1.\n\nNow it's just Agent2, Agent4, and Agent8. Agent6 is dead, and we know Agent6 was the werewolf. So my goal now is to figure out who among Agent2, Agent4, and Agent8 is the other werewolf.\n\nAgent2, you voted for Agent1 yesterday, who was actively investigating. Agent4, you've been consistently voting NOONE. Agent8, you were consistently suspicious of Agent6.\n\nGiven Agent1's elimination, and Agent2's vote for Agent1, I'm now suspicious of Agent2. Agent4's quietness could be genuine caution or it could be a werewolf trying to stay out of the spotlight. Agent8's consistent targeting of Agent6 could have been a genuine villager, or it could have been a werewolf trying to push a specific narrative.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent1 was a sharp player, actively trying to deduce the werewolf and vocalizing their suspicions, particularly towards Agent6. Their death, coming after Agent6's elimination, suggests the werewolf is still active and is targeting the remaining investigators.\n\nWe are now down to Agent2, Agent4, and myself (Agent8). Agent2 voted for Agent1 yesterday, which, in retrospect, was a smart move if they were trying to deflect attention from themselves. Agent4 has been consistently voting NOONE, which is a safe strategy, but doesn't offer much insight.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was so actively trying to uncover the truth and is now dead, it means the werewolf is still among us and is actively silencing the investigators. Agent2, your vote for Agent1 yesterday was a key moment. Agent4, your consistent neutrality is also something to consider.\n\nI think the pattern of the werewolf eliminating the most active investigators is clear. Agent1 was a key investigator, and their death confirms the werewolf is still hunting. We need to identify who is left who could also be considered a threat to the werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
