This is a tricky situation, as the initial vote to eliminate Agent4 didn't create a clear target for us. Given that Agent3 was the first to suggest a kill, and now they've abstained from voting, I'm going to lean towards them as someone who might be trying to manage the situation from a villager perspective.

Agent0's statement about looking for inconsistencies is a good strategy, but it could also be a bluff. Agent2 is also playing it safe by not making accusations. I'm going to focus on Agent0.
