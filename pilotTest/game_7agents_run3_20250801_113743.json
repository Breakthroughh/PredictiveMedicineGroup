Agent1 also echoed that the werewolf might be targeting active information gatherers. Agent5 and Agent2 both continued to advocate for observation. Agent6 asked for observations, and Agent4 expressed difficulty seeing patterns.\n\nIt's clear the werewolf is actively eliminating people. Agent3 and Agent6 were both fairly neutral or trying to gather information.

Given that Agent0, Agent3, and Agent6 were all killed, and none of us have been able to identify a werewolf yet, it's very difficult. The \"observation\" strategy seems to be failing to protect us.

Agent2 has also been relatively reserved, mirroring my approach. Agent4 has been more vocal in expressing their confusion and desire to find leads.\n\nSince the werewolf is actively killing, and we've had no successful eliminations, the werewolf is likely among us. The fact that no one has been voted out yet suggests a reluctance to commit to a vote, or a fear of voting out a villager.\n\nLet's look at who hasn't been *attacked* by the werewolf.

Agent4 has expressed confusion and difficulty seeing patterns, and also voted NOONE. My own statements have been about observing and trying to piece things together.\n\nGiven that Agent5 voted for me, and I am a werewolf, that suggests Agent5 was either a villager who was trying to expose me, or perhaps a villager who was genuinely suspicious of me. However, Agent5's consistent \"observing\" and voting NOONE previously makes their vote for me a bit of a surprise.\n\nNow it's just us three. The werewolf must be either Agent1 or Agent4. Agent1 has been very passive, which could be a strong cover. Agent4 has been expressing confusion, which could also be a very good cover for a werewolf who is struggling to keep track of their own actions or is trying to lull us into a false sense of security.\n\nIf Agent1 is the werewolf, their consistent NOONE votes and passive statements would make sense. If Agent4 is the werewolf, their expressed confusion could be a good way to avoid suspicion.\n\nI need to make a decision. I've been playing the cautious, observing role. Agent1 has done the same.

The werewolf is clearly still among us and is incredibly effective at eliminating us.\n\nLooking back at the last discussion:\nAgent5 voted for Agent1.\nAgent4 voted NOONE.\nAgent1 voted NOONE.\nAgent2 voted for Agent5.\n\nSo, Agent2 voted for Agent5, who was then killed. This is a critical piece of information. Agent2 correctly identified Agent5 as a potential threat. Agent4 and Agent1, however, did not vote, which allowed Agent5 to survive that round and then be killed last night.\n\nAgent2's vote against Agent5, and the fact that Agent5 was then killed, makes Agent2 a strong candidate for being a villager who correctly identified a threat. Agent1 and Agent4's inaction allowed the werewolf to strike again.\n\nI am Agent4. I voted NOONE because I genuinely had no idea who to trust. My initial instinct was that the consistent \"observers\" (Agent1, Agent2, Agent5) were suspicious, but Agent2's vote against Agent5 complicates things. If Agent2 is a villager, then Agent1 and I are the remaining suspects. If Agent2 is the werewolf, then their vote against Agent5 could be a misdirection.\n\nGiven that we are down to three, and the werewolf is still active, it's a critical decision. Agent2 identified Agent5. Agent5 is dead. Agent1 and I did not vote for anyone.

We are the final three.\n\nLooking back at the last discussion, Agent2 voted for me, Agent1. My response was \"VOTE: NOONE\". Agent4 voted \"NOONE\".\n\nNow, Agent5 (who is dead) voted for me, Agent1. Agent4 voted \"NOONE\". Agent2 voted for Agent5.\n\nThis is very confusing. Agent5 was killed, and they voted for me. That means either Agent5 was a villager trying to eliminate a suspected werewolf (me), or they were a werewolf trying to eliminate a perceived threat or someone who might be investigating them.\n\nAgent2 voted for Agent5. This means Agent2 likely believes Agent5 was the werewolf. If Agent2 is a villager, then Agent5 was indeed the werewolf. If Agent2 is a werewolf, then they might be trying to frame Agent5, or perhaps they're trying to eliminate a potential threat to themselves (Agent5, who might have been a villager).\n\nI need to consider my own actions. I have been consistently observing and voting NOONE until the last round where I had to make a choice. My reasoning for voting NOONE was that no one had enough information. Agent5's vote for me on the last day is concerning, but their death could mean I was wrong, or it could mean they were trying to get me out before I could expose them.\n\nIf Agent5 was the werewolf, then their vote for me would be a misdirection. If Agent2 is the werewolf, their vote for Agent5 could be to frame them.\n\nLet's reconsider Agent5's last statement: \"I'm going to vote for Agent1. Their consistent 'observation' feels like a way to avoid revealing themselves or making a mistake that would expose them.\" This sounds like a villager trying to logically deduce who might be hiding something.\n\nNow consider Agent2's last statement: \"Agent6 was asking for observations and seemed to be genuinely trying to figure things out. Agent5 and Agent1 are still focused on observing. Agent4 is expressing concern and a struggle to find patterns. I, too, am trying to piece things together. With Agent6 gone, the remaining players are Agent1, Agent2, Agent4, and myself. It seems the werewolves are systematically eliminating people who are either asking too many questions or are being too quiet. Agent6's direct questioning yesterday might have made them a target. Since everyone is still playing it very safe, it's difficult to identify a clear suspect without any solid evidence or slips of the tongue. We need to make a move to eliminate someone to try and break this cycle. Agent5's consistent 'observing' stance could be a way to avoid drawing attention, but it also means they're not contributing much to the discussion.\" Agent2 then voted for Agent5. This sounds like a reasoned deduction from a villager.\n\nIf Agent5 and Agent2 are both villagers, then Agent5's vote for me was a mistake, and Agent2 correctly identified Agent5 as the werewolf. However, the werewolf killed Agent5 last night. This is where it gets tricky.\n\nIf Agent5 was the werewolf, and Agent2 correctly identified them, why would the werewolf kill Agent5? That doesn't make sense. The werewolf is trying to survive.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that either Agent2 is the werewolf and framed Agent5, or Agent5 was a villager who made a mistake in their vote.\n\nLet's assume Agent5 was a villager. Their vote against me was either a misdirection or a genuine suspicion. Agent2 correctly identified Agent5 as the werewolf (from their perspective). If Agent5 was indeed the werewolf, and Agent2 identified them, the werewolf would not kill Agent5.\n\nThis means the werewolf is likely Agent2. Agent2 voted for Agent5 to frame them. The werewolf (Agent2) then killed Agent5 to eliminate a villager and also potentially someone who might have identified them.\n\nMy previous voting NOONE was because I didn't have enough information. Now, with Agent5 dead and their vote against me, and Agent2's vote for Agent5, I need to make a decision.\n\nIf Agent2 is the werewolf, they would want me to vote for Agent4. Agent4's last statement was \"Agent6's death is absolutely devastating. We've lost Agent0, Agent3, and now Agent6. This is becoming a slaughter. We're down to just four: Agent5, Agent4, Agent1, and Agent2. The werewolf is clearly efficient and is picking us off one by one. Agent6 was asking for observations yesterday, just like I was. It feels like anyone trying to actively participate and gather information is a target. I still have no solid leads, but the fact that so many of us who were trying to lead the investigation are gone is very telling.\" This sounds like a confused villager.\n\nI believe Agent2 is the werewolf. Their statements have been a bit more verbose, and their vote for Agent5 in the last round, given that Agent5 was killed, points to a misdirection.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
