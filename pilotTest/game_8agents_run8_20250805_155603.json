It seems Agent7 was a strong suspect for most people. Now Agent2 is dead, and Agent7 is gone.\n\nI'm still Agent5. The pattern of the werewolf killing those who are actively trying to uncover them, or those who are being accused, is a strong indicator. Agent0 was killed after voting for Agent7. Agent7 was killed after being voted for by multiple people, including Agent0 and Agent2. Agent2, who voted for Agent7, is now dead.\n\nIf the werewolf is trying to eliminate those who are making accusations, then Agent7 being killed makes sense. But then Agent2 being killed is odd, as they were accusing Agent7. This could mean that Agent7 *wasn't* the werewolf, or that the werewolf is trying to eliminate anyone who *might* have been close to the truth, even if they were wrong.\n\nLet's reconsider. Agent7 was vocal and accused Agent2. Agent0 voted for Agent7. Agent2 accused Agent7. Agent1 and Agent4 also voted for Agent7. It really seemed like Agent7 was the target. Agent0's death could have been the werewolf trying to silence someone who was already suspicious of the werewolf (who they thought was Agent7). Then Agent2's death, after they voted for Agent7, is the most confusing part.\n\nWhat if the werewolf was trying to *protect* Agent7 from being eliminated by sowing doubt elsewhere? Agent5 initially seemed too quick to dismiss Agent6 (according to Agent7), which is odd.

Agent2 voted for Agent7, and Agent3 voted for Agent7. Agent1 voted for Agent7. My vote was also for Agent7. Agent7 was the only one actively voting on day 1, targeting Agent2. Then Agent0, who voted for Agent7, was killed. Agent7 then voted for Agent2, and Agent2 was killed. This is very confusing.\n\nIt seems like the wolves are either eliminating the most vocal players, or they're trying to eliminate people who are making accusations, hoping to create confusion. Agent7 was the most vocal and accusing, and they were eliminated. Then Agent2, who was accused by Agent7, and then voted against Agent7, was eliminated. This pattern is difficult to read.\n\nHowever, all of us remaining, Agent5, Agent3, Agent4, and Agent1, have voted for Agent7 at some point, or at least remained relatively neutral, not making wild accusations.\n\nLet's look at the pattern of votes:\nDay 1: Agent7 voted for Agent2. Agent0 voted for Agent7.\nDay 2: Agent4, Agent5, Agent2, Agent3, Agent1 voted for Agent7. Agent7 voted for Agent2. (Agent7 eliminated)\nDay 3: Agent2 was killed. (No vote occurred due to elimination)\n\nIt seems like Agent7 was a target for many, and their actions were suspicious. If Agent7 was the werewolf, then their elimination should have stopped the killing, but Agent2 was killed. This implies Agent7 was not the only werewolf, or my deduction was wrong.\n\nIf Agent7 was indeed a werewolf, then the remaining wolves are Agent5, Agent3, Agent4, and Agent1. The fact that Agent7 was eliminated after being voted for by almost everyone, and yet another player was killed, is extremely concerning.\n\nLet's reconsider. Agent7 was very active in Day 1, pointing fingers at Agent2. Agent0, who voted for Agent7, was killed on Night 2. This could suggest Agent7 was a werewolf and silenced Agent0, or Agent7 was being targeted by the werewolf and Agent0 was trying to help by voting for Agent7. Agent7 then voted for Agent2 on Day 2. Agent2 was killed on Night 3. This points towards Agent7's actions having some weight.\n\nHowever, if Agent7 was the werewolf, why was Agent2 killed after Agent7 was eliminated? This means there must be another werewolf among us.\n\nConsider Agent3 and Agent1 who remained neutral for so long. Agent5 also stayed quiet.\n\nAgent3, Agent5, and Agent1, you all voted for Agent7 on Day 2. Agent2 also voted for Agent7. So, we all seemed to agree that Agent7 was a threat.\n\nGiven that Agent2 was killed after Agent7's elimination, and Agent7 was the primary focus of accusations, this is becoming more complex.\n\nLet's re-examine Agent7's initial statement: \"Agent2 was the one who initially pointed towards Agent6, so I'm keeping an eye on them.\" This was an incorrect statement, as Agent6 was killed, not pointing at anyone. Agent7 then said, \"Agent5 also seemed a little too quick to dismiss Agent6.\" Agent7 was trying to deflect from themselves.\n\nThe fact that Agent2 was killed after Agent7's elimination makes me think that the werewolves are trying to eliminate anyone who is getting close. Agent7 was making accusations, and Agent2 was also making accusations against Agent7.\n\nI am Agent4. My role is to deduce the werewolf. I've been trying to be observant.\n\nLet's go with who was actively making moves and drawing attention. Agent7 was certainly doing that. Agent2 was accused by Agent7, and then Agent2 was killed.\n\nI'm going to stick with my previous assessment that Agent7 was a strong suspect. However, since Agent7 is gone and Agent2 is dead, this suggests a coordinated effort or multiple werewolves.\n\nLet's consider the remaining players: Agent3, Agent5, Agent4 (myself), Agent1.\nWe all seemed to align against Agent7.\n\nThis is a tough one. If Agent7 was the werewolf, then the killing of Agent2 means another werewolf is active. If Agent7 was a villager, then the werewolves are among the rest of us and successfully framed Agent7.\n\nGiven the elimination of Agent7, and then Agent2, it's possible the werewolves are trying to eliminate those who are actively accusing others. Agent7 was accusing, and Agent2 was accusing Agent7.\n\nI will vote for Agent3. Agent3 has been relatively quiet, but their initial neutral stance could be a way to hide.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

We are down to Agent5, Agent4, and Agent1.\n\nLet's recap the suspicious actions and eliminations:\nNight 1: Agent6 killed.\nDay 1: Agent7 voted Agent2. Agent0 voted Agent7. Agent1, Agent2, Agent3, Agent4, Agent5 voted NOONE.\nNight 2: Agent0 killed.\nDay 2: Agent7 voted Agent2. Agent0 voted Agent7. Agent2 voted Agent7. Agent3 voted Agent7. Agent4 voted Agent7. Agent5 voted Agent7. Agent1 voted Agent7. Agent7 was eliminated.\nNight 3: Agent2 killed.\nDay 3: Agent4 voted Agent3. Agent5 voted Agent3. Agent1 voted Agent5. Agent3 voted Agent2. (No majority, Agent7 eliminated)\nNight 4: Agent3 killed.\n\nMy vote on Day 3 was for Agent3. Agent1 voted for Agent5. Agent4 voted for Agent3.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed after Agent7 was eliminated, and my vote was for Agent3, is very concerning. Agent7 was eliminated, and then Agent2 was killed, and then Agent3 was killed.\n\nAgent7 was eliminated on Day 2, after a lot of people, including myself, voted for them. Then Agent2 was killed. Then Agent3 was killed.\n\nLet's consider who was consistently active or making accusations: Agent7. Agent7 was eliminated.\nWho was consistently neutral or passive: Agent1, Agent5.\nWho made specific accusations: Agent7 (accused Agent2, Agent5), Agent0 (voted Agent7), Agent2 (accused Agent7), Agent4 (accused Agent7), Agent1 (voted Agent7), Agent3 (voted Agent7).\n\nThe pattern of eliminating those who are actively trying to find the werewolf is strong. Agent7 was eliminated, and then Agent0 (who voted for Agent7) was killed. Then Agent2 (who accused Agent7 and voted for Agent7) was killed. And now Agent3 (who voted for Agent7) is killed.\n\nThis leaves Agent5, Agent4, and Agent1. If the werewolf is trying to eliminate active investigators, and we have eliminated Agent7 who was the most active accuser, it should have stopped the killings. But it hasn't.\n\nThis suggests that the werewolf might be the quiet ones, or that the killings are not directly related to accusation, but rather to eliminating people who could potentially identify them.\n\nLet's look at the votes today (Day 3):\nAgent4 voted Agent3.\nAgent5 voted Agent3.\nAgent1 voted Agent5.\nAgent3 voted Agent2.\n\nIt seems like Agent7 was indeed a target, but the killings continued. This means the werewolf is still among us.\n\nIf Agent1 voted for Agent5, that's a direct accusation. Agent5 and Agent4 voted for Agent3.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed after Agent7's elimination is a huge clue. Agent7 was seen as a threat. Agent3 was also seen as a threat by voting for Agent7.\n\nI am Agent5. I am trying to deduce the werewolf. My previous votes for Agent7 were based on their activity. My vote for Agent3 on Day 3 was because they were also actively participating by voting.\n\nNow, with Agent3 dead, and us down to three, this is critical.\n\nConsider Agent1's vote for Agent5. That's a direct accusation. Agent5 (myself) and Agent4 voted for Agent3.\n\nIf the werewolf is trying to eliminate those who are actively trying to uncover them, then the killings of Agent0, Agent2, and Agent3 make sense as they were all part of the group trying to figure things out.\n\nI suspect Agent1. Their vote for Agent5 is a clear indication of suspicion, and they have been relatively quiet otherwise.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent7 was eliminated, then Agent2 was killed, and now Agent3 is killed.

Agent1 voted for Agent5. Agent4 voted for Agent3. Agent3 voted for Agent2 (who was already dead, which is odd for Agent3).\n\nWait, Agent3 voted for Agent2 on Day 3, even though Agent2 was killed on Night 3. This is a critical error in Agent3's statement if they were trying to be logical. This could be a mistake, or it could be a deliberate misdirection. Agent3's initial neutrality was also suspicious.\n\nLet's look at the votes against each other from Day 3.\nAgent5 voted Agent3.\nAgent1 voted Agent5.\nAgent4 voted Agent3.\nAgent3 voted Agent2 (dead).\n\nGiven Agent3's odd vote for a dead person on Day 3, and my own vote for Agent3 yesterday, it's hard to say. But Agent3 being killed now is very suspect. If Agent3 was the werewolf, why would they get killed after being targeted by Agent5 and myself?\n\nLet's reconsider Agent1's vote on Day 3 for Agent5. This could be a genuine suspicion, or an attempt to deflect from themselves by targeting another villager.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed after being targeted by Agent5 and me means either the werewolf is trying to eliminate *all* vocal participants, or Agent3 was indeed a werewolf and they were successfully eliminated by the other werewolf(s) and me, or Agent3 was a villager and was eliminated by the werewolf who is either Agent1 or Agent5.\n\nAgent1 voting for Agent5 yesterday is a key piece of information. Agent5's vote for Agent3 is also important.\n\nIf Agent3 was the werewolf, then the killer last night was either Agent1 or Agent5.\nIf Agent3 was a villager, then the killer last night was either Agent1 or Agent5.\n\nAgent1 voted for Agent5 yesterday. This means Agent1 suspected Agent5.\nAgent5 voted for Agent3 yesterday. This means Agent5 suspected Agent3.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead. This means the werewolf is either Agent1 or Agent5.\nIf Agent1 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent5 to appear innocent.\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent3 to appear innocent, and then perhaps the werewolf (Agent5) eliminated Agent3.\n\nI'm going to trust Agent1's vote against Agent5. Agent1's rationale for voting Agent5 was that Agent5's vote for Agent3 was \"a little too quick.\"\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

Then Agent2 was killed, and Agent7 had accused them. Agent0 was killed after voting for Agent7. Agent3 was just killed.\n\nLet's look at the voting patterns again. On Day 2, Agent4, Agent5, Agent2, Agent3, and Agent1 all voted for Agent7. Agent7 voted for Agent2. Agent7 was eliminated. Then Agent2 was killed. Then Agent3 was killed.\n\nIf Agent7 was a werewolf, then the elimination of Agent7 by everyone else should have stopped the killings, but Agent2 was killed. This points to Agent7 not being the only werewolf.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead. Agent5 and Agent1 both voted for Agent7 on Day 2. I, Agent4, also voted for Agent7 on Day 2. Agent3 also voted for Agent7 on Day 2.\n\nConsider Agent5 and Agent1. Both of them have been relatively quiet. Agent5 voted NOONE on Day 1, and then voted for Agent7 on Day 2. Agent1 also voted NOONE on Day 1, and then voted for Agent7 on Day 2.\n\nIf Agent7 was a werewolf, then eliminating Agent7 would be the goal. But then Agent2 was killed. If Agent2 was a werewolf, then Agent7's elimination was a mistake by the village.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed after a round where Agent5 and Agent1 remained relatively neutral, and after the village voted as a block against Agent7, is highly suspicious. It suggests that the werewolf is among the remaining quiet players who might be trying to appear innocent.\n\nI previously voted for Agent3, but that was based on an assumption about their quietness. Now that Agent3 is gone, the pattern is even more muddled.\n\nIf Agent7 was indeed the werewolf, then eliminating them should have been the end of the killings. Since Agent2 and Agent3 were killed *after* Agent7 was eliminated, this means either:\n1. Agent7 was not the werewolf, and we eliminated a villager, and the actual werewolf(s) continued to kill.\n2. Agent7 was a werewolf, and there are other werewolves among us.\n\nGiven that Agent5 and Agent1 have been so quiet throughout this, it's a common werewolf strategy to stay silent and let others accuse each other. Agent7's elimination seemed like a consensus, but the continued killings are the real indicator.\n\nI am Agent4. I've been trying to observe and deduce. My vote for Agent3 yesterday was a guess.\n\nLet's look at who is left: Agent5 and Agent1. One of them has to be the werewolf.\n\nAgent5, you said \"Agent2 seemed neutral, like me.\" This is interesting. Agent2 also voted NOONE on day 1, like you and Agent1.\n\nIf Agent7 was the werewolf, then their elimination of Agent0 makes sense (silencing a suspicious player). Then Agent7's elimination of Agent2 makes sense (silencing someone who was suspicious of them). Then Agent7's elimination of Agent3 makes sense (silencing another investigator).\n\nBut Agent7 was eliminated on Day 2. And Agent2 and Agent3 were killed *after* that. This means the werewolf is not Agent7.\n\nSo, Agent7 was likely a villager who was targeted. Agent0, Agent2, and Agent3 were all killed.\n\nThe most consistent behavior I've seen from potential werewolves are those who remain silent and observe, or those who make slightly off-kilter accusations. Agent7's initial misstatement about Agent2 pointing at Agent6 was odd.\n\nHowever, the most telling thing is the continued killings after the elimination of someone who was a suspect.\n\nAgent5, you said Agent2 seemed neutral \"like me.\" This is a statement of solidarity.\n\nAgent1, you've been very quiet.\n\nI am Agent4. My vote yesterday was for Agent3. Now Agent3 is dead.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Agent5 and Agent1 are working together. Or one of them is the werewolf.\n\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, their statement \"Agent2 seemed neutral, like me\" could be a way to draw suspicion away from themselves by grouping themselves with a perceived \"safe\" player like Agent2 (who is now dead).\n\nIf Agent1 is the werewolf, their silence is their primary weapon.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed after the village seemed to have converged on Agent7 suggests that the werewolf might be someone who was overlooked during that consensus.\n\nI will vote for Agent5.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",
