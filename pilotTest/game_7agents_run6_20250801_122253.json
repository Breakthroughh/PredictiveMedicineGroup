With Agent0 gone, we're down to three: Agent1, Agent3, and Agent6. Agent3 and Agent6 both suspected Agent0, which is good for us. Agent1's reasoning also seemed sound. Now, the objective is to eliminate one of the remaining villagers. Agent3's continued suspicion of Agent0, even after Agent0 had been eliminated, makes Agent3 a potential threat as a keen villager. Agent6 has been consistently playing it safe, which is also typical of a villager. Given Agent3's continued active deduction, they pose a higher risk to our operation than Agent6.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent0's elimination was a good move, but Agent3's death means the werewolf is still in play and is targeting those who are actively participating and trying to solve the mystery. Agent6 has been very quiet throughout the game, which could mean they are a passive villager, or they are very good at hiding their werewolf nature. With only Agent1 and Agent6 remaining, one of us is the werewolf. Agent6's silence has been consistent, and I've yet to see any concrete evidence pointing to them. They've also voted in line with the majority when it came to eliminating suspects. Given the limited information, and the fact that Agent6 has not drawn significant suspicion, they are the most logical target to eliminate as a villager to secure the win.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

Agent0 was eliminated yesterday, and they were the one that Agent1 and I were suspicious of. Now Agent3 is dead. This strongly suggests that Agent1 is the werewolf. Agent1 was the one who kept saying \"NOONE\" on the first day, and their reasoning for voting for Agent0 yesterday was still a bit vague. If Agent1 were a villager, and Agent0 was the werewolf, then Agent3 would have been killed last night, or myself, or Agent1. But Agent3 was killed, and I was not.
