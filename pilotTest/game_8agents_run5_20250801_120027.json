This is consistent with my strategy to deflect suspicion, by having the werewolf eliminate someone who was actively questioning and trying to uncover the truth. Agent6, Agent7, and Agent4 are still the ones who were pointing at me yesterday. Agent2 was also passive but is now questioning me and others. Agent7 and Agent4 were very quiet yesterday, while Agent6 commented on the situation. It\u2019s hard to tell if Agent2 or Agent7 is a werewolf. Agent6 is also quiet. Agent4\u2019s focus on me yesterday was noted. I will continue to lay low and let the villagers suspect each other.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

It's concerning that Agent1, who was trying to investigate, is now gone.\n\nYesterday, Agent5 voted for Agent0, and then Agent5 was killed. Agent6 and Agent7 both voted for Agent0. Agent0 voted NOONE. Agent4 voted for Agent0. Agent2 voted NOONE. The majority was to vote for Agent0, but there wasn't a majority to eliminate.\n\nNow, Agent1 is dead. This could mean Agent1 was getting too close, or it could be a red herring. Agent0's consistent \"NOONE\" votes are a bit strange. Agent7 also voted for Agent0 yesterday, and then asked Agent0 directly what their thoughts were, and then Agent0 remained quiet.\n\nAgent6 also voted for Agent0 yesterday. Agent4 voted for Agent0. Agent2 seems to be taking a similar approach to me, trying to observe and gather information, but they also voted NOONE yesterday, which is interesting considering the accusations against Agent0.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was the target of multiple votes yesterday and is consistently voting NOONE, I still find them suspicious. Agent1's death after questioning Agent0 and Agent7 is also a point of concern.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

      "content": "Agent1 being killed on Night 3 is a huge loss. Agent1 was actively trying to question people and draw out information. This strongly suggests the werewolf is trying to silence investigators.\n\nLet's recap:\nNight 1: Agent3 killed.\nDay 1: Everyone is cautious. Agent5 votes for Agent0. Agent1 questions Agent0 and Agent7.\nNight 2: Agent5 killed.\nDay 2: Agent6 and Agent7 vote for Agent0. Agent0 votes NOONE. Agent1 continues to question Agent0 and others. Agent4 votes for Agent0. Agent2 votes NOONE.\nNight 3: Agent1 killed.\n\nAgent0 survived two votes against them (one by Agent5, and then a general push from Agent6, Agent7, and Agent4). Agent0's strategy of being quiet and voting NOONE is consistent. However, Agent5 and Agent1, who were actively investigating, are now dead. This pattern points strongly to the werewolf being someone who wants to shut down investigation, which could be Agent0, or perhaps someone who is afraid of Agent0 being investigated.\n\nAgent7, Agent2, and Agent6 are still in play. Agent7's initial statements were cautious, but they did vote for Agent0 on Day 2. Agent2 has consistently voted NOONE, stating they are looking for behavior. Agent6 has also been generally quiet but voted for Agent0 on Day 2.\n\nAgent4 also voted for Agent0 on Day 2.\n\nThe fact that Agent1, a proactive investigator, was killed, suggests the werewolf is actively eliminating those who are asking the most questions and trying to uncover the truth. Agent0 has been relatively passive, though Agent5 and others targeted them.\n\nGiven that Agent5, who voted for Agent0, was killed, and Agent1, who was asking pointed questions, was killed, I still lean towards Agent0 as a prime suspect. However, the werewolf could also be someone who is trying to make Agent0 look guilty by voting for them.\n\nLet's consider who benefited from Agent1's death. The people who were being questioned by Agent1 were Agent0 and Agent7. The people who were *not* questioned by Agent1 were Agent2, Agent4, and Agent6.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, killing Agent1 would be a good move to stop further investigation into them. If Agent0 is innocent, then the werewolf is targeting anyone who is investigating, including Agent1.\n\nAgent7's vote for Agent0 on Day 2 is interesting, as is Agent6 and Agent4's. Agent2 remained silent.\n\nConsidering Agent1 was killed after probing Agent0 and Agent7, and the werewolf is clearly trying to stop investigation, I'm going to stick with my suspicion.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent4 was also quiet.\n\nGiven Agent5 voted for Agent0, and then Agent5 was killed, and then Agent1 was killed (who was probing Agent0), it's starting to feel like Agent0 is indeed the werewolf. Agent0's continued silence, while everyone else is being killed for speaking or investigating, is making me more suspicious. Agent0 hasn't offered any theories or defenses, just statements of observation and a vote for NOONE yesterday.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
