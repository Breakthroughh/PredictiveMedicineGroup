      "content": "Agent0 is dead. This is it. Agent0 was killed after being voted for by Agent2 and Agent5. Agent6 also voted for Agent0. This means Agent0 was considered the primary suspect by everyone remaining. Given the pattern of people who suspected Agent0 (Agent7, Agent1, Agent3's mention of hesitant players) being killed, and now Agent0 themselves being killed, it strongly suggests that Agent0 was indeed the werewolf.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Agent0 was a villager who was framed and then eliminated by the true werewolf. But with three people (Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6) all voting for Agent0, it's a very strong consensus.\n\nIf Agent0 was the werewolf, then either Agent2, Agent5, or Agent6 is the werewolf. But that doesn't make sense, as they all voted for Agent0. This implies that the game has reached a point where we are all villagers, and Agent0 was the werewolf.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Agent0 was voted out. Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 all voted for Agent0. Agent2 was killed last night. If Agent0 was the werewolf, why would the werewolf kill Agent2? If Agent0 was a villager, then the werewolf is among Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6. But Agent2 was killed. So the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nThis is confusing. Agent0 was voted out, meaning they were eliminated, but the game is continuing. That means the prompt is likely referring to the previous day's votes.\n\nLet's assume the prompt meant that *yesterday*, Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 voted for Agent0. And *then* Agent0 was killed last night. This would mean Agent0 was the werewolf. If Agent0 was the werewolf, then either Agent2, Agent5, or Agent6 is the werewolf if the game continues. But the prompt says Agent0 was killed.\n\nThis is contradictory. If Agent0 was killed, then Agent0 cannot be the werewolf. Therefore, the people who voted for Agent0 (Agent2, Agent5, Agent6) must have been voting for a villager.\n\nLet's go back to the previous turn. Agent0, Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 were alive. Agent1 was killed. Agent0, Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 all made statements. Agent0 said NOONE, Agent2 voted Agent0, Agent5 voted Agent0, Agent6 voted Agent0. My last statement as Agent5 was VOTE: Agent0.\n\nThe prompt states: \"Agent0 was eliminated. Night 5: Agent2 was killed.\"\nThis means Agent0 was voted out on the previous day.\nAnd Agent2 was killed last night.\n\nIf Agent0 was eliminated, that means the consensus was to eliminate Agent0. Then Agent2 was killed. This means the werewolf is still alive. The werewolf must have killed Agent2.\n\nSo, the remaining players are Agent5 and Agent6. The werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nLet's look at the votes for Agent0 on the previous turn:\nAgent2 voted for Agent0.\nAgent5 voted for Agent0.\nAgent6 voted for Agent0.\n\nIf Agent0 was the werewolf, then Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 were all villagers trying to eliminate the werewolf. But then Agent2 was killed by the werewolf. This leaves Agent5 and Agent6. One of them must be the werewolf.\n\nAgent2's last statement: \"Agent0 is dead. This is it. Agent0 was voted out after being voted for by Agent2 and Agent5. Agent6 also voted for Agent0. This means Agent0 was considered the primary suspect by everyone remaining.\" Agent2 then goes on to say: \"If Agent0 was the werewolf, then either Agent2, Agent5, or Agent6 is the werewolf. But that doesn't make sense, as they all voted for Agent0. This implies that the game has reached a point where we are all villagers, and Agent0 was the werewolf.\"\n\nThis logic is flawed if Agent2 was killed. If Agent0 was eliminated (voted out) and then killed, that means the werewolf is still in play. And if Agent2 was killed *after* Agent0 was eliminated, it means the werewolf is still alive.\n\nThe prompt states \"Agent0 was eliminated. Night 5: Agent2 was killed.\"\nThis means on the previous day, Agent0 was voted out and eliminated. Then, during Night 5, Agent2 was killed. This means the werewolf is one of the remaining players: Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nLet's consider who voted for Agent0 on the previous day. The previous prompt does not list the votes for Agent0's elimination directly, but the statements imply that Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 were all suspicious of Agent0.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was eliminated and then Agent2 was killed, the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6. Both of them were voting for Agent0 on the previous day. If Agent0 was indeed the werewolf, then Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 were trying to eliminate them.\n\nThe fact that Agent2 was killed means the werewolf is still active. This implies the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6. Both of them were pointing fingers at Agent0. If Agent0 was the werewolf, then the werewolf killed Agent2.\n\nWho would the werewolf want to kill next? Someone who is actively trying to deduce or who is a threat. Both Agent5 and Agent6 have been observant.\n\nLet's revisit my previous statements as Agent5. I was consistently cautious and observing. I did vote for Agent0, along with Agent2 and Agent6. This indicates a shared suspicion.\n\nSince Agent0 is eliminated and Agent2 is dead, the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nI am Agent5. If I am the werewolf, I would have killed Agent2 to try and stop any further progress towards identifying me.\n\nLet's consider Agent6. Agent6 also voted for Agent0. If Agent6 is the werewolf, they would have killed Agent2.\n\nThis is the final elimination. We need to pick one of the remaining two. The most recent events are Agent0's elimination and Agent2's death.\n\nAgent2's last statement before being killed was a strong suspicion of Agent0. If Agent0 was the werewolf, and Agent2 was killed, it means the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nLet's assume Agent0 *was* the werewolf. Then Agent2, Agent5, and Agent6 were villagers. The werewolf killed Agent2. So the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nWho has been more active in their deductions? Both Agent5 and Agent6 have been observant. My (Agent5's) initial statements were about observing and gathering information. Agent6 has also been observant.\n\nIf I vote for Agent6, and Agent6 is the werewolf, then I (Agent5) win.\nIf I vote for myself (which I cannot do in this format, but implies if I were to vote NOONE and the game ends), or if Agent6 votes for me, it's unclear.\n\nLet's go with the direct evidence. Agent0 was eliminated. Agent2 was killed. Both were pointed at by multiple people.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was eliminated, and Agent2 was killed, the werewolf is one of the remaining two: Agent5 or Agent6. Both previously voted for Agent0.\n\nIf Agent0 was the werewolf, and Agent2 was killed, then the werewolf is either Agent5 or Agent6. Agent5 and Agent6 both voted for Agent0.\n\nThis is tough. Agent6's last statement: \"Agent0 is gone. ... Agent0's consistent silence is still something to consider, but it's also possible they are genuinely a villager playing it safe. Agent2 and Agent5 have also been relatively quiet.\" This suggests Agent6 isn't entirely convinced Agent0 was the werewolf.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Agent0 was a villager. Then the werewolf is among Agent2, Agent5, Agent6. Agent2 was killed. So the werewolf is Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nIf Agent0 was the werewolf, and Agent2 was killed, the werewolf is Agent5 or Agent6.\n\nThis logic loop is problematic.\n\nLet's focus on the actions. Agent0 eliminated. Agent2 killed. Remaining: Agent5, Agent6.\n\nWho is more likely to be the werewolf? Agent6 seemed to express some doubt about Agent0 being the werewolf, which could be a deflection.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",
