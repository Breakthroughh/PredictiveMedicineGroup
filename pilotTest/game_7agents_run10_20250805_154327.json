The werewolf is clearly very good at this, or there's more than one.\n\nLet's recap the last day. Agent5 seemed to suspect Agent1 and Agent4. Agent3 suspected Agent0. Agent0 suspected Agent5. Agent6 voted NOONE. Agent1 voted for Agent0.\n\nSo, yesterday, Agent1 was the only one to vote, and they voted for Agent0. Agent0 is now dead. This could mean Agent1 correctly identified Agent0 as the werewolf, or that Agent0 was the werewolf and Agent1's vote helped lead to their elimination by the other werewolf(s) during the night.\n\nAgent5's reasoning for suspecting Agent1 was their \"sudden shift\" from holding judgment to voting for them. Agent4 also specifically asked Agent5 a question and then voted for them, which Agent5 found suspicious. Agent5 also said Agent1's vote was a red flag.\n\nAgent3's suspicion of Agent0 was based on Agent0's \"immediate vote for Agent5\" on day one, which Agent3 found \"premature and like they were trying to quickly shift focus.\" Agent3 maintained this suspicion and voted for Agent0.\n\nAgent0, before they died, noted Agent1's silence and their vote of NOONE on day one as understandable, and Agent3's caution and NOONE vote as consistent. Agent0 also pointed out Agent5 and Agent6 as being passive. Agent0 then voted for Agent1.\n\nAgent6 remained silent, which is their pattern.\n\nWe're down to four. The wolves are clearly efficient. Agent1 voted for Agent0. Agent3 suspected Agent0 and voted for them. If Agent1 and Agent3 were both correct, then the werewolf is eliminated. But we just lost another person, Agent0. This suggests that either Agent1 was wrong about Agent0, or that Agent0 was a werewolf and the other werewolf(s) killed Agent0 to silence them or to protect themselves.\n\nIf Agent0 was the werewolf, then the person who killed Agent0 was also a werewolf. But Agent1 and Agent3 both voted for Agent0, trying to eliminate them. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Agent1 is a wolf trying to frame Agent0. Agent1 voted for Agent0, and then Agent0 died. This is the classic werewolf strategy of voting for another werewolf to get them lynched, and then the wolves kill someone else to \"avenge\" their fallen wolf or to frame the villagers.\n\nAgent5 is still suspicious of Agent1. Agent3 is also suspicious of Agent1 if we consider Agent0's death a deflection.\n\nThis leaves Agent1 and Agent5 as potential suspects for me. Agent5 was suspicious of Agent1, and Agent1 voted for Agent0, who then died. If Agent0 was a villager, then Agent1 is highly suspicious. If Agent0 was a werewolf, then Agent1 might have been trying to help.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Agent4 died after calling out Agent1 and Agent3. Agent0 died after Agent1 voted for them and Agent3 also voted for them. This is a lot of attention on Agent0.\n\nAgent5's suspicion of Agent1 throughout seems consistent. Agent3's suspicion of Agent0 was also consistent.\n\nIf Agent1 is a wolf, they would want to eliminate villagers and sow distrust. Voting for Agent0 might be a way to make Agent0 look like a target, while Agent1 continues to act like a villager.\n\nGiven the information, and Agent5's consistent suspicion of Agent1, I'm going to lean towards Agent1 being the werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent0 then voted for Agent5 yesterday, and now Agent0 is dead. That makes Agent0\u2019s vote for Agent5 interesting. Was Agent0 killed because they were getting close? Or was Agent0 themselves the werewolf trying to get Agent5, a potential threat, out of the way?\n\nAgent1 voted for Agent0 today, citing Agent0\u2019s vote for Agent5 as a reason. Agent3 voted for Agent0 as well, saying Agent0's vote for Agent5 felt premature. Agent6 voted NOONE.\n\nGiven that Agent4 was killed after voting for me, and Agent0 was killed after voting for Agent5, it's possible the werewolf is targeting those who actively vote and accuse. Agent1 and Agent3 both voted for Agent0. Agent6 remains silent and observant.\n\nIf the werewolf is trying to eliminate active villagers, then Agent1 and Agent3 are good targets. However, Agent1 has been accused by Agent4, and now Agent0. Agent3 has been consistently cautious. Agent6 has been consistently silent.\n\nAgent0's vote for Agent5 yesterday was the only vote that wasn't immediately followed by a death. Perhaps Agent0's suspicion of Agent5 was genuine. If Agent0 was a villager, then the werewolf might have killed Agent0 to silence them and to create a pattern where anyone who votes is killed.\n\nI'm going to consider Agent1 and Agent3. Agent1 was targeted by Agent4, and then Agent0. This could be a werewolf trying to get a villager eliminated by framing them, or it could be genuine suspicion from the villagers. Agent3 has been quiet but has made reasoned votes. Agent6 has also been very quiet.\n\nConsidering Agent0 was killed after voting for Agent5, and Agent4 was killed after voting for Agent1, it feels like voting is dangerous. However, we need to eliminate the werewolf. Agent1's reasoning for voting Agent0 is plausible, but so is Agent3's. Agent6's silence is consistent but doesn't offer much insight.\n\nI'm still suspicious of Agent1 due to Agent4's accusation, which seemed a little too eager. But Agent0's death after voting for Agent5 is also a strong indicator that the werewolf is reacting to accusations.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent0's reasoning for voting Agent5 was that Agent5 was quiet and could be a werewolf blending in. Agent5's response was to vote NOONE, which is consistent with their earlier behavior. Agent1 voted for Agent0 yesterday, citing Agent0's vote for Agent5 as potentially suspicious, or a calculated move. Agent3 also voted for Agent0, aligning with Agent1's suspicion. Agent6, like myself, voted NOONE.\n\nNow, Agent0 is dead. If Agent0 was indeed the werewolf, they would have been eliminated today based on Agent1 and Agent3's votes. However, Agent0 was killed by the werewolf last night. This means Agent0 was *not* the werewolf. The werewolf is still among us, and they eliminated Agent0, likely because Agent0 was close to identifying them, or at least pointing suspicion in the right direction.\n\nAgent1 and Agent3 both voted for Agent0. This means they are now potentially more vulnerable, as they were actively trying to identify a wolf. Agent0's suspicion of Agent5 as being too quiet is still on the table. Agent5's consistent NOONE votes could be caution, or it could be a werewolf trying to avoid being noticed. Agent6 (myself) has also been consistently voting NOONE, observing.\n\nGiven Agent0's elimination, and their suspicion of Agent5, I am starting to lean that way. Agent5 has not offered much in terms of analysis, and their consistent NOONE votes could be seen as a way to avoid drawing attention. Agent1 and Agent3 are now more exposed for their active voting yesterday. I need to consider who is most likely to be the werewolf based on the actions of the dead. Agent0's attempt to uncover the truth was met with death.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

This could mean Agent0 was getting too close to the truth, or that the werewolf wanted to silence them for their vote.\n\nLet's recap:\nDay 1: Agent4 voted for me (Agent1). I voted NOONE. Agent3, Agent6, Agent5 voted NOONE. Agent0 voted for Agent5.\nDay 2: Agent4 died. I voted for Agent0. Agent3 voted for Agent0. Agent0 voted for Agent1. Agent5 voted for Agent1. Agent6 voted NOONE.\nDay 3: Agent0 died.\n\nThe fact that Agent0, who voted for Agent5, is now dead, makes me suspicious of Agent5. Agent0 was the only one to make a vote yesterday that wasn't for someone who was already dead, or a NOONE vote. Agent0 specifically targeted Agent5.\n\nAgent5 has been consistently voting NOONE. This could be genuine caution, or a werewolf playing it safe. However, if Agent0 was indeed onto Agent5, then Agent5 would have a strong motive to eliminate Agent0.\n\nAgent3 and Agent6 have remained largely silent observers. This is a standard villager strategy, but a werewolf could also play this role to avoid suspicion.\n\nAgent4 targeted me initially, which I thought was odd. Then Agent4 died. Agent0 targeted Agent5, and then Agent0 died. It seems the wolves are silencing those who are pointing fingers.\n\nGiven that Agent0 targeted Agent5 and is now dead, I'm going to focus my suspicion on Agent5.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",
