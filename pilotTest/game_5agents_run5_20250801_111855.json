To continue this momentum, we should eliminate someone who could be a strong villager. Agent1 has been relatively quiet, but has also acknowledged the good questions asked by Agent2. Agent3 is also asking good questions and trying to identify motives.\n\nThis is a tough decision. If we eliminate Agent1, Agent3 might be left to carry the villager torch. If we eliminate Agent3, Agent1 remains. Both are currently playing a cautious game.\n\nLet's think about who is most likely to be actively trying to figure things out and could pose a threat.
