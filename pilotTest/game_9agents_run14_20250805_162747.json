If Agent0 was indeed the werewolf, then our village has successfully identified and removed one.\n\nNow, who is left? Agent1, Agent3, Agent4, Agent6, Agent7, Agent8. We need to remain vigilant. Agent1, Agent4, Agent7, and Agent8 were very vocal in their suspicion of Agent0. Agent3 was also convinced. I still haven't made a strong accusation.\n\nGiven the recent success, it might be strategic to continue observing the dynamics of those who were vocal. However, if Agent0 was indeed the only werewolf, then we are now in a village-only phase, and the goal is to survive. But if there are still werewolves, they would want to disrupt this unity.\n\nLet's consider Agent1. They were quite vocal about Agent0 being the werewolf, linking Agent5's death to Agent0's accusation. This could be genuine deduction or a clever ploy. If there's another werewolf, they might try to eliminate someone who is actively trying to solve the mystery, or someone who is too quiet.\n\nAgent1's reasoning seemed solid from a villager perspective. If we assume Agent0 was the werewolf, then Agent1 did a good job. If Agent0 was a villager, then Agent1 could be the werewolf trying to frame Agent0. However, the collective vote against Agent0 makes it less likely that Agent1 is the sole remaining werewolf acting alone.\n\nLet's consider Agent4. They also pointed to Agent0's vote against Agent0 as suspicious. Agent7 and Agent8 echoed similar sentiments. Agent3 also fell in line.\n\nAs for me, I've been playing cautiously, observing. My previous NOONE vote was to gather more information. Now that Agent0 is gone, and there's a strong consensus that Agent0 was the werewolf, it's important to see if anyone tries to sow discord or makes an uncharacteristic move.\n\nAgent1's early and consistent focus on Agent0 makes them a potential wolf if Agent0 was innocent. But for now, the consensus points to Agent0. I don't want to draw undue attention to myself by making a random accusation, especially when there seems to be agreement on Agent0's removal.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

This could mean that Agent0 was indeed the werewolf, and the villagers, by eliminating them, have made progress. However, it's also possible that the werewolf is very good at manipulating the votes and has managed to get a villager eliminated.\n\nLooking back at yesterday's discussion, Agent0 claimed they didn't have much to go on, but then Agent5 voted for them. Agent5 then made a statement about watching everyone's reactions, and then Agent5 was killed. Agent0's reaction to Agent5's death was to emphasize how it \"clearly [isn't] helping us find the werewolf.\" This is a bit of deflection.\n\nMany people voted for Agent0 yesterday (Agent1, Agent4, Agent8, Agent7, Agent3). Agent6 voted NOONE. Agent0 voted NOONE. Given the pattern, and Agent0's somewhat passive reaction to Agent5's death while being the focus of suspicion, I still think Agent0 was a strong candidate. Now that Agent0 is gone, we need to reassess.\n\nAgent7's statement about Agent0's silence being \"noted by Agent5\" is interesting, but Agent7 also abstained from voting yesterday. Agent4 and Agent8 pointed out the connection between Agent5's vote and their death, and then Agent0's death. Agent3 also noted the oddity of Agent5's vote without reason and Agent0's subsequent elimination. Agent6 remains the only one who voted NOONE yesterday, and still has not offered a strong opinion.\n\nI am going to stick with the initial suspicion.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

I voted for Agent0 yesterday, thinking that Agent5 might have had a reason, and that Agent0's silence was suspicious. Now Agent0 is out. Agent5's death, immediately after they voted for Agent0, made me suspect the werewolf was protecting Agent0, or retaliating. Agent1, Agent4, Agent8, Agent7, and Agent6 all voted NOONE yesterday. Agent6 explicitly stated they didn't have enough information and wanted to observe. Agent7 also pointed out that the silence of many was noted by Agent5.\n\nNow that Agent0 is dead, we have Agent1, Agent4, Agent3, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent8 left. Agent5's vote for Agent0 has been validated by Agent0's elimination, though we don't know if Agent0 *was* the werewolf or just a target of opportunity. The fact that Agent0 is dead means the werewolf is still among us.\n\nI'm still wary of Agent0's initial silence and then their brief statement after Agent5's death, where they still didn't offer much. But they're gone. Agent5's death right after voting for Agent0 was a big red flag for me. Who else might have been trying to frame Agent0 or protect them by eliminating Agent5? Or was Agent5 simply a villager who made a correct accusation and was then eliminated?\n\nI think Agent1 and Agent4 both quickly jumped on the \"vote Agent0\" train. Agent8 also voted for Agent0, agreeing it was concerning. Agent7 also voted Agent0. Agent6 voted NOONE, saying they needed more information. I voted Agent0 as well, trying to follow up on Agent5's suspicion.\n\nNow that Agent0 is gone, it's even harder. I need to consider who might have benefited from Agent0's elimination, or who might have been trying to *prevent* Agent0 from being eliminated if Agent0 was a villager. Agent6's cautious approach still seems reasonable. The pattern of victims is Agent2, then Agent5. Agent2 was killed on Night 1, no votes yet. Agent5 was killed on Night 2, after voting for Agent0. Agent0 was eliminated by vote on Day 3.\n\nGiven that the werewolf killed Agent5 after Agent5 voted for Agent0, it suggests Agent0 might have been a villager, and the werewolf eliminated Agent5 for being a threat. Or, Agent5 was a werewolf and eliminated Agent0, but that's less likely if Agent0 wasn't an active threat. The most likely scenario is Agent5 was a villager who correctly identified Agent0, and the werewolf silenced Agent5. But Agent0 is gone now.\n\nI'm going to stick with the idea that the werewolf is trying to stay hidden. Agent6's continued caution is noted. Agent1, Agent4, and Agent8 all seemed quick to vote for Agent0. Agent7 also voted for Agent0, citing the silence of others.\n\nI'm going to vote for someone who was also cautious and didn't jump on the Agent0 bandwagon too quickly. Agent6's reasoning to wait and observe still seems sound.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

It could mean that the werewolf is targeting those who are not actively participating in accusations, or perhaps those who are trying to maintain a neutral stance.\n\nHowever, Agent8 and Agent3 previously voted for Agent6. If Agent6 is indeed a werewolf, then they might be trying to eliminate those who suspect them. But Agent1's vote was NOONE, which doesn't directly implicate Agent6.\n\nAgent1's earlier suspicion of Agent0 was well-articulated. With Agent0 gone and now Agent1 gone, the pool of potential suspects is shrinking. Agent4 also voted NOONE yesterday, along with myself. This could mean we are both seen as neutral or non-threatening, or it could be that the werewolf wants to eliminate those who are not actively participating in the accusations.\n\nAgent3 and Agent8 were the ones who voted for Agent6. If Agent6 is innocent, then they might be the werewolf who is trying to eliminate those who are suspicious of them. But Agent6's consistent NOONE votes make it hard to pin down.\n\nThe pattern of killings: Agent2 (Night 1), Agent5 (Night 2, after voting for Agent0), Agent0 (Day 3 vote), Agent1 (Night 4, after voting NOONE).\n\nThe fact that Agent1 voted NOONE yesterday, along with Agent4 and myself, and Agent1 is now dead, is a point of concern. It could be that the werewolf is eliminating those who aren't actively pointing fingers, or it could be that the werewolf is eliminating anyone who might eventually identify them.\n\nAgent8 and Agent3 have been more active in trying to identify suspects, voting for Agent6. This could be genuine suspicion, or it could be a werewolf trying to eliminate another active villager or even a fellow werewolf to appear more innocent.\n\nGiven that Agent8 and Agent3 have been more vocal in their accusations, and Agent4 and I have been more reserved, I need to consider who might be the werewolf among those who have been more quiet or more actively suspicious.\n\nAgent8 and Agent3's targeting of Agent6 yesterday is a notable shift. If Agent6 is innocent, then Agent8 and Agent3 might be the culprits, trying to frame Agent6. Or, if Agent6 is the werewolf, then Agent8 and Agent3 are on the right track.\n\nI'm still leaning towards caution. Agent3 and Agent8's decision to vote for Agent6 yesterday was a significant move. Let's see if that suspicion is maintained or if they shift their focus.\n\nI am going to vote for Agent3. They were one of the players who made a direct accusation yesterday against Agent6. This could be a genuine villager trying to root out a threat, or it could be a werewolf trying to deflect suspicion from themselves by making an accusation against another player.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

This really makes me question my vote for Agent6 yesterday. If Agent0 was the werewolf, then Agent6's abstention yesterday is less suspicious than if Agent0 was a villager.\n\nWe have Agent4, Agent3, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent8 left. Agent1 was killed, and Agent1 was part of the majority that voted for Agent0. This could mean the werewolf is trying to eliminate those who are actively trying to solve the mystery, or they are eliminating people who might have been close to figuring them out.\n\nAgent6, you consistently voted NOONE. Agent4, Agent3, Agent7, and Agent8 all voted for Agent0 yesterday. I also voted for Agent0. Now Agent1 is dead.\n\nI am really unsure. Agent6, your continued lack of a vote is making you more suspicious to me. It's like you're waiting for everyone else to make a move.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",
