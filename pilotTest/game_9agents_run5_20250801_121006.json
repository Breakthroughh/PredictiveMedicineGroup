This back-and-forth is a lot of noise, and it's hard to discern who is telling the truth.\n\nGiven that Agent7 is actively trying to point fingers and is being very vocal about werewolf tactics, they could be a threatening villager or a wolf trying to deflect. Agent8 is also actively engaging and making accusations. Between the two, Agent7\u2019s early vote against Agent7 (on Day 1, which was a mistake in the logs) and their recent accusation against Agent8 makes them seem slightly more erratic, which could be a tactic to throw suspicion off themselves if they are a werewolf.\n\nIf I can get Agent8 to vote for Agent7, that would be ideal. However, I need to pick a target. Since Agent7 is being so vocal and trying to organize the village against Agent8, eliminating Agent7 would remove a potentially disruptive villager.\n\nVOTE: Agent7",

Agent2's reasoning for voting Agent8 was also interesting, suggesting a potential werewolf trying to deflect by questioning others. Agent5's vote for Agent6 is also something to consider.\n\nGiven the continued pattern of losing village players, and Agent8's aggressive questioning and targeting, I still find them to be a strong suspect.

Agent6 has been fairly consistent in their observational approach, and Agent5's sudden targeting of them is suspicious. It's possible Agent5 is trying to create a distraction or remove a potential threat to themselves if Agent6 was onto them.\n\nSince we have a good majority pointing at Agent8, and that worked out, I'll stick with the consensus.

The consensus was strong. Then Agent5 voted for Agent6, which was an outlier. Agent5 then got killed last night. This strongly suggests that Agent5 was a werewolf trying to eliminate Agent6, who was suspicious of them.\n\nNow we have Agent1, Agent2, Agent3, and Agent6 left. If Agent5 was a werewolf, and Agent2 and Agent8 are likely villagers (based on their votes for Agent8), then the remaining werewolves could be among Agent1, Agent3, or Agent6.\n\nAgent6 has been consistently saying they are observing and listening. Agent3 has been analyzing and pointing out suspicious behavior. Agent1 has been mostly quiet, but also observing.\n\nGiven that Agent5's vote for Agent6 was the outlier and Agent5 was killed, it strongly points to Agent5 being a werewolf. This leaves the possibility of one more werewolf. Agent3 and Agent6 seem to have been on the same page in voting for Agent8, and Agent1 also voted for Agent8.\n\nIt's hard to say definitively who the remaining werewolf is. Agent6's consistent \"observing\" could be genuine or a facade. Agent3's analysis could be genuine or a cover. Agent1's quietness could be anything.\n\nSince Agent5 was eliminated because of their suspicious vote against Agent6, and the rest of us seemed to be correctly identifying a potential werewolf in Agent8, I think we need to trust that line of reasoning.\n\nI'm going to trust the majority vote from yesterday that pointed to Agent8. If Agent5 was the werewolf, then we need to consider who else might be. Agent6's vote against Agent5 makes me think Agent6 might be a villager. Agent3 also voted for Agent8, which aligns with my suspicion of them. Agent1 has been quiet, making them a bit of an unknown.\n\nIf Agent5 was the werewolf, and Agent8 was also potentially a werewolf (as many suspected), then eliminating Agent8 was a good move. Now we need to find the last one.\n\nI'm going to stick with my suspicion of Agent3, as their analysis could be a good cover. However, Agent1's quietness is also a concern.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that Agent6 is also a werewolf. Agent5 voted for them. This could mean Agent5 was trying to eliminate a fellow werewolf, or Agent5 was trying to eliminate a villager they suspected.\n\nGiven the situation, and the fact that Agent3 and Agent6 both voted for Agent8, and Agent1 also voted for Agent8, I'm going to lean towards the idea that Agent8 was indeed a werewolf. If Agent5 was the other werewolf, then we have eliminated both. But we can't be sure.\n\nThe safest bet is to continue focusing on who has been making the most potentially suspicious moves that are not necessarily aligned with the majority. Agent5's vote for Agent6 was the most out of sync with the general suspicion towards Agent8.\n\nSince Agent5 is gone, and we had a good consensus on Agent8, I think we should continue to focus on who might be the remaining werewolf. Agent3's detailed analysis could be a performance. Agent6's quiet observation could be a deliberate tactic.\n\nI'm going to vote for Agent3 because their consistent analysis and pointing out of details could be a way to distract from their own actions or to frame others.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

The consensus yesterday was that Agent8 was the primary suspect, with Agent2, Agent3, and Agent1 all voting for them. Agent6 voted for Agent5, and Agent5 voted for Agent6. Then Agent5 was killed last night, which seemed to validate the suspicions against Agent5.\n\nHowever, Agent6's earlier vote for Agent5, and Agent5's vote for Agent6, is still highly suspicious. If Agent5 was a werewolf, then Agent6's vote against them is a bit of a puzzle. If Agent6 is a werewolf, then Agent5 voting for them is also a puzzle.\n\nThe fact that Agent8 was eliminated, and Agent5 killed last night, means we're likely dealing with at least one more werewolf. Agent6's consistent observation and listening, without much concrete suspicion until the very end, is starting to feel like a calculated performance. Agent3's detailed analysis is also a strong candidate for a werewolf trying to control the narrative. Agent1's quietness is a wildcard.\n\nGiven the current situation, and the fact that Agent6 voted for Agent5, who was then eliminated, it's highly probable that Agent6 is the werewolf. Agent5's vote for Agent6 could have been a last-ditch effort to take down a fellow werewolf before being eliminated, or it could have been a genuine suspicion that didn't lead to a village vote.\n\nHowever, I need to be strategic. If Agent6 is indeed the werewolf, then eliminating them is the best course of action. Agent3's analysis has been helpful, and Agent1's quietness doesn't immediately scream werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

That means Agent8 was a villager, and the remaining werewolves are among Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\n\nLet's retrace. Agent8 was eliminated yesterday. Most of us voted for Agent8: Agent2, Agent3, Agent6, and Agent1. This means Agent8 was likely a villager. Then Agent5 was killed last night. Agent5 had voted for Agent6 on Day 3, and Agent6 had voted for Agent5. Agent6's suspicious vote for Agent5, followed by Agent5's death, pointed heavily towards Agent6. My previous deduction was that Agent6 was the werewolf.\n\nHowever, Agent6 was killed last night, and Agent5 was the one who voted for Agent6. This is a massive contradiction to my previous deduction. If Agent5 voted for Agent6, and Agent6 was killed, then Agent5 was likely a villager trying to eliminate a suspected werewolf (Agent6). But then, if Agent5 was a villager, who killed Agent6? And who killed Agent5?\n\nThis means my previous assessment was likely flawed. If Agent6 was killed last night, and Agent5 was the one who voted for them, then Agent5 was likely trying to eliminate a werewolf. But if Agent5 was trying to eliminate a werewolf, and Agent6 was that werewolf, then Agent5 wouldn't have been killed by the werewolf.\n\nThe only way this makes sense is if Agent5 was NOT a villager trying to eliminate Agent6.\n\nLet's look at who voted for Agent8 yesterday: Agent2, Agent3, Agent6, Agent1. This means Agent8 was likely a villager.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\n\nThen Agent5 was killed. This means the werewolf killed Agent5. If Agent5 was killed by the werewolf, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, then the werewolf is NOT Agent6. This means Agent5 was killed by a werewolf who is not Agent6. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet's go back to my conviction: Agent6 was the werewolf. I made this deduction based on Agent5 voting for Agent6, and then Agent5 being killed. This implies Agent5 was a villager trying to expose Agent6, and the werewolf (Agent6) killed Agent5. BUT, Agent6 was killed last night. This contradicts Agent6 being the werewolf.\n\nThis means my assumption about Agent5's vote was wrong, or the werewolf is someone else entirely.\n\nIf Agent6 was killed last night, then the werewolf is not Agent6.\nThe werewolf is among Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\n\nLet's reconsider:\nAgent2, Agent3, Agent6, Agent1 voted for Agent8. Agent8 was eliminated. This means Agent8 was likely a villager.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\nLast night, Agent5 was killed.\n\nIf Agent5 was killed by the werewolf, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, then Agent6 is likely a villager. This means the werewolf is not Agent6.\nThen, Agent6 was killed last night. This means the werewolf is not Agent6.\n\nThis is a paradox. If Agent6 was the werewolf, Agent5 would have been killed by the werewolf, and Agent6 would have killed Agent5. But then Agent6 was killed last night.\n\nThe only way this works is if there are two werewolves. If Agent6 and Agent5 are the werewolves, they would have eliminated villagers. But they voted for each other. This doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's assume the majority vote for Agent8 was correct and Agent8 was a villager.\nThen the werewolf is among Agent1, Agent2, Agent3, Agent5, Agent6.\nAgent5 and Agent6 voted for each other. This is a classic werewolf move to try and eliminate each other or sow confusion.\nAgent5 was killed. This means the werewolf killed Agent5.\nIf Agent5 was killed, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, then Agent6 is likely NOT the werewolf who killed Agent5.\n\nThen, Agent6 was killed. This means the werewolf killed Agent6.\n\nThis means Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3 are the only ones left.\nThe werewolf killed Agent5 and Agent6. This means the werewolf is among Agent1, Agent2, or Agent3.\n\nLet's look at the votes for Agent8 yesterday: Agent2, Agent3, Agent6, Agent1. All voted for Agent8. This means Agent8 was likely a villager.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\n\nAgent5 was killed last night. This means the werewolf killed Agent5.\nAgent6 was killed last night. This means the werewolf killed Agent6.\n\nThis is impossible if there is only one werewolf. If Agent5 and Agent6 were killed, and they were voting for each other, and the werewolf killed them both, then the werewolf is one of Agent1, Agent2, or Agent3.\n\nLet's consider who benefited from Agent5 and Agent6's deaths. Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3 are left.\n\nAgent3 has been actively analyzing and pointing out details. This could be a villager role or a werewolf trying to control the narrative.\nAgent1 has been very quiet. This could be a villager observing or a werewolf playing it safe.\nAgent2 has also been analyzing, similar to Agent3.\n\nLet's reconsider the Day 3 votes:\nMajority voted for Agent8: Agent2, Agent3, Agent6, Agent1. So Agent8 was likely a villager.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\n\nAgent5 was killed. This means the werewolf killed Agent5.\nIf Agent5 was killed by the werewolf, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, then Agent6 is likely a villager, and the werewolf is not Agent6.\n\nThen Agent6 was killed. This means the werewolf killed Agent6.\nIf Agent6 was killed by the werewolf, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, then Agent5 was likely trying to eliminate a werewolf. But then Agent5 was killed.\n\nThis is a contradiction. The only way Agent5 and Agent6 are both killed is if the werewolf is among Agent1, Agent2, or Agent3.\n\nLet's assume the most recent elimination of Agent6 is the key. Agent6 was killed last night. Who benefits from Agent6's death? Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\nYesterday, Agent6 voted for Agent5. Agent5 voted for Agent6. Agent5 was killed last night.\n\nThis suggests that Agent5 was likely a villager trying to eliminate a suspected werewolf (Agent6). But then, if Agent6 was the werewolf, Agent6 would have killed Agent5, not the other way around.\n\nThe fact that Agent6 was killed last night is the most critical piece of information now. If Agent6 is dead, they cannot be the werewolf.\n\nThis leaves Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\n\nConsider Agent3's consistent analysis. This could be a well-played villager, or a skilled werewolf.\nConsider Agent1's quietness. This could be genuine observation or a werewolf playing it safe.\nConsider Agent2's analysis. Similar to Agent3.\n\nGiven that Agent5 voted for Agent6, and then Agent6 was killed, it points to Agent6 being a suspect from Agent5's perspective. Agent6 was also killed last night.\n\nThis is a very tricky situation. The werewolf is clearly trying to eliminate those who are actively participating and observing.\n\nLet's review my previous actions: I voted for Agent6, believing them to be the werewolf. This was based on Agent5 voting for Agent6, and then Agent5 being killed, which I interpreted as Agent6 killing Agent5. However, Agent6 was killed last night.\n\nThis means my previous deduction was wrong. The werewolf is NOT Agent6.\n\nThe remaining players are Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\nAgent3 has been very analytical, and has consistently pointed out details and voted for suspects like Agent8.\nAgent1 has been very quiet, but also consistently voted for suspects like Agent8.\nAgent2 has also been analytical and voted for suspects like Agent8.\n\nIf Agent8 was a villager, and Agent5 and Agent6 were killed by the werewolf, then the werewolf is one of Agent1, Agent2, or Agent3.\n\nI'm going to focus on who has been consistently trying to guide the village's suspicions, as this can be a werewolf tactic. Agent3's detailed explanations and voting patterns seem consistent with a villager trying to uncover the truth. Agent1's quietness is still a concern.\n\nHowever, let's look at the last few votes:\nYesterday, Agent2, Agent3, Agent6, Agent1 voted for Agent8.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\n\nAgent5 was killed last night. Agent6 was killed last night.\n\nThis means the werewolf killed Agent5 and Agent6.\nIf Agent5 and Agent6 are dead, then the werewolf is among Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3.\n\nConsider Agent3's consistent analysis. It's possible Agent3 is a strong villager, or a werewolf playing the long game. Agent1's silence is also a concern.\n\nGiven that Agent5 voted for Agent6, and Agent6 voted for Agent5, and they were both killed, it suggests they were perhaps both targeting each other, or they were both victims of the werewolf.\n\nThe most sensible conclusion is that the werewolf is among the remaining three: Agent1, Agent2, Agent3. Agent3 has been the most vocal and analytical, which can be a double-edged sword.\n\nI will vote for Agent3.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Majority voted NOONE. Agent0 killed.\nDay 3: Agent2 voted Agent8. Agent3, Agent1, Agent6 voted Agent8. Agent5 voted Agent6. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent8 killed.\nDay 4: Agent2 voted Agent5. Agent3 voted Agent8. Agent6 voted Agent5. Agent1 voted Agent8. Agent5 voted Agent6. Agent5 killed.\nDay 5: Agent3 voted Agent6. Agent6 voted Agent1. Agent1 voted Agent6. Agent2 voted Agent6. Agent6 killed.\n\nThis is very confusing. Agent6 was killed last night. This means the werewolf didn't vote for Agent6. If Agent6 was the werewolf, then Agent1 or Agent3 is the other werewolf. If Agent6 was a villager, and Agent1 and Agent3 are the werewolves, then Agent6 would have been killed by them.\n\nLet's retrace the suspicion. Agent6 was voted for by Agent2, Agent1, and Agent3 on Day 5. Agent6 voted for Agent1. Agent5 voted for Agent6 on Day 4, and Agent6 voted for Agent5. Agent5 was then killed. This indicates Agent5 was likely a werewolf trying to get rid of Agent6.\n\nAgent6's death last night means the werewolf did *not* target Agent6. This strongly suggests that Agent1 or Agent3 is the werewolf, and they are working together. Agent6 was voted for by all the remaining villagers.\n\nSo, the werewolf is either Agent1 or Agent3. Agent6's last action was to vote for Agent1. This could mean Agent6, in their last moments, was trying to identify the werewolf. Or, it could mean Agent6 was trying to frame Agent1.\n\nGiven that Agent1 has been quiet for most of the game, their vote for Agent6 on Day 5 is a strong indicator that they were trying to identify the werewolf. Agent3 also voted for Agent6.\n\nIf Agent1 is the werewolf, their quietness was a good cover. Agent3's detailed analysis could also be a cover.\n\nLet's think about the pattern of kills: Agent4, Agent0, Agent7, Agent5, Agent6. These are all players who were actively participating or trying to gather information.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 voted for Agent6, and Agent3 voted for Agent6, and Agent2 also voted for Agent6, means that the village was united in suspecting Agent6. If Agent6 was the werewolf, then the remaining werewolf must be Agent1 or Agent3.\n\nConsider Agent1's consistent NOONE votes in the earlier stages. This could be a deliberate strategy to avoid suspicion.\n\nGiven that we are down to three, and the werewolves are likely Agent1 and Agent3, I need to make a choice. Agent1's quietness is more suspicious to me at this stage than Agent3's analysis, which has been somewhat helpful in pointing out patterns.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

I was certain Agent6 was the werewolf after their vote for Agent5 on Day 3, followed by Agent5's death. But the game continued, and Agent6 was killed. This means Agent6 was not the werewolf, and my deduction was wrong.\n\nWe are now down to three: Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3. Agent6 was killed last night, meaning the werewolf is one of us.\n\nLet's look back at the votes from Day 3, which led to Agent8's elimination:\nAgent2 voted for Agent8.\nAgent3 voted for Agent8.\nAgent1 voted for Agent8.\nAgent6 voted for Agent5.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nThe majority (Agent2, Agent3, Agent1) voted for Agent8. This eliminated Agent8.\nThen, Agent6 was killed last night. This confirms Agent8 was not the werewolf, and neither was the person who killed Agent6.\n\nThis means the werewolf must be either Agent1, Agent2, or Agent3.\n\nAgent6 voted for Agent5 on Day 3. Agent5 voted for Agent6. This exchange itself is highly suspicious. If Agent5 was a villager, they might have voted for Agent6 because they suspected them. If Agent6 was a werewolf, they might have voted for Agent5 to try and deflect or to eliminate a fellow werewolf who was being too obvious. However, since Agent6 was killed, it points to Agent5 being a potential werewolf, or someone else entirely.\n\nGiven that Agent6 is dead, and we know Agent5 was also killed, the werewolf is among the remaining three.\nAgent2, Agent3, and Agent1.\n\nI, Agent3, have been actively analyzing and making deductions. I voted for Agent8 yesterday.\nAgent2 also voted for Agent8 and expressed suspicion towards Agent8's questioning.\nAgent1 voted for Agent8.\n\nNow that Agent6 is dead, we need to consider who could have killed them. The werewolf is one of us.\n\nAgent1's consistent NOONE votes early on were safe, but they also voted for Agent8 yesterday. Agent2 also voted for Agent8.\n\nMy suspicion has now shifted. Agent1 has been relatively quiet throughout the game, with their most notable action being a NOONE vote in the early stages and then a vote for Agent8. Their quietness could be a cover.\n\nGiven that Agent6 was killed, and the majority of us (Agent2, Agent3, Agent1) were focused on Agent8, and Agent6 was voting for Agent5, who then voted for Agent6, the situation is complex.\n\nHowever, with only three left, and Agent6 gone, and Agent8 eliminated, the werewolf is one of us.\n\nI am leaning towards Agent1. Their consistent, but not overly aggressive, participation, coupled with a lack of strong personal accusations against anyone other than the general focus on Agent8, makes them a potential candidate for a werewolf who is playing it safe.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",
