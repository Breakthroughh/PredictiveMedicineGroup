Agent1 and I both voted for Agent6. Agent2 voted for Agent1. Agent5, again, remained neutral.\n\nIf I were a villager, I'd be looking at who is left. Agent2 voted for Agent1 yesterday, who is now dead. Agent5 has been consistently neutral. I voted for Agent6, who is now dead.\n\nThe fact that Agent6 is dead means the werewolf felt threatened by them or wanted them gone. Agent6 was quite vocal, trying to piece things together and calling out suspicions. Perhaps that made them a target.\n\nNow, it's a game of three. It's highly likely one of us is the werewolf. Agent5's neutral voting pattern is still a bit suspicious, but it could also be caution. Agent2's vote for Agent1 yesterday could have been a genuine suspicion.\n\nSince I am a werewolf, and Agent5 has been consistently voting NOONE, it suggests they are trying to avoid being the killer or being accused. Agent2 is the only other player who has made a definitive accusation (against Agent1). If Agent2 is a villager, then they are likely targeting the werewolf. If Agent2 is a werewolf, they would be trying to eliminate me or Agent5.\n\nLet's consider the implications. If Agent2 is a villager, and they are suspicious of me or Agent5, they might vote for one of us. If Agent5 is a villager, they might vote for me or Agent2.\n\nGiven that I (Agent3) voted for Agent6, and Agent2 voted for Agent1, and Agent6 is now dead, it means the werewolf also targeted Agent6. Agent5 voting NOONE means they didn't want to make a move.\n\nThis is a critical moment. If Agent2 is a villager, they are likely trying to figure out who the werewolf is. My previous votes for Agent6 and Agent1 were attempts to look like a villager who is trying to solve the mystery.\n\nAgent5's consistent NOONE votes could mean they are a villager who is scared, or they are a werewolf trying to avoid suspicion by appearing non-committal. Agent2's votes have been more active.\n\nLet's assume Agent2 is a villager. They are likely trying to eliminate the werewolf. Agent5's neutrality is a wildcard. If I vote for Agent5, and Agent2 also votes for Agent5, then Agent5 is eliminated. If Agent5 is a villager, that's bad. If Agent5 is a werewolf, that's good.\n\nIf I vote for Agent2, and Agent5 votes for Agent2, then Agent2 is eliminated. If Agent2 is a villager, that's bad. If Agent2 is a werewolf, that's good.\n\nThe safest play for me as a werewolf is to try and eliminate the player who is most likely to be a villager and is also vocal. Agent2 has been vocal in their accusations.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

This means that the werewolf is actively targeting those who are vocal and trying to lead the investigation.\n\nLet's recap the votes leading to Agent1's elimination:\nAgent1 voted for Agent6.\nAgent3 voted for Agent1.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\nAgent6 voted for Agent1.\nAgent2 voted for Agent1.\n\nSo, Agent1 was targeted by Agent3, Agent6, and Agent2. Agent5 and Agent1 both targeted Agent6.\n\nNow, Agent6 is dead. This means the werewolf was likely one of the people who voted for Agent1 (Agent3, Agent6, Agent2), or someone who abstained from voting against Agent1 and instead targeted Agent6.\n\nAgent2 voted for Agent1. Agent3 voted for Agent1. Agent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent1 to try and get a villager lynched, and then killed Agent6 because Agent6 was onto them or was a threat.\nIf Agent2 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent1 to try and get a villager lynched, and then killed Agent6 because Agent6 was onto them or was a threat.\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent6 to try and throw suspicion elsewhere, and then killed Agent6 themselves because Agent6 was close to figuring them out. This seems less likely since Agent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nThe fact that Agent6, who was also actively investigating, is now dead, suggests the werewolf is trying to eliminate the most active villagers. Agent2 and Agent3 are the remaining players who were actively voting. Agent5 has been more reserved.\n\nLet's consider Agent2 and Agent3. Agent2 voted for Agent1, and Agent3 voted for Agent1. Agent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent6 to try and deflect suspicion. Why would they kill Agent6 then? It doesn't add up.\n\nThis leaves Agent2 and Agent3. Agent2 and Agent3 both voted for Agent1. Agent6 voted for Agent1, and then Agent6 was killed. Agent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nGiven that Agent6 was killed, and Agent5 voted for Agent6, it's possible Agent5 is trying to eliminate those who pointed suspicion at them, or someone they are allied with. However, Agent5 also voted NOONE on previous days.\n\nI need to consider who would benefit most from Agent6's death. Agent2 and Agent3 are the remaining players who had previously voted for Agent1. If Agent1 was a villager, then Agent2 and Agent3 were wrong, and the werewolf could be among them.\n\nLet's re-examine the votes for Agent1: Agent3, Agent6, Agent2. Agent5 voted for Agent6.\nAnd the votes for Agent6: Agent1, Agent5.\n\nIf Agent1 was a villager, then Agent6's vote for Agent1 was a mistake, and Agent6 was killed by the werewolf, likely because Agent6 was getting too close. Agent5's vote for Agent6 is also confusing if Agent6 was a villager.\n\nIf the werewolf is Agent5, then they voted for Agent6 to try and deflect suspicion, and then killed Agent6. This is possible. They would want to eliminate Agent6 as Agent6 was very active.\n\nIf the werewolf is Agent2 or Agent3, they voted for Agent1, and then killed Agent6. This is also possible.\n\nI'm going to assume Agent5 is the werewolf. They've been relatively quiet, but also have voted strategically. Their vote for Agent6, who was then killed, makes them a prime suspect for trying to eliminate a strong investigator.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

We are down to three players: Agent2, Agent3, and Agent5.\n\nLet's look at the recent votes:\nDay 2: Agent1 was eliminated.\nVotes for Agent1: Agent3, Agent6, Agent2.\nVotes for Agent6: Agent1, Agent5.\n\nNight 3: Agent6 was killed.\nMy vote was for Agent6. Agent2 voted for Agent1. Agent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nNow, Agent6 is dead. This means the werewolf did not vote for Agent6, or they voted for Agent6 and then killed them (which is impossible). So, the werewolf did *not* vote for Agent6. The werewolf voted for Agent1.\n\nThis means either Agent2 or Agent3 is the werewolf. Agent5 voted for Agent6, which could be a villager trying to eliminate a threat, or a werewolf trying to deflect suspicion.\n\nConsidering the votes on Day 2:\nAgent3 voted for Agent1.\nAgent2 voted for Agent1.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent1 to try and lynch a villager. Then, on Night 3, the werewolf (Agent3) killed Agent6. This means Agent3 must have seen Agent6 as a threat.\n\nIf Agent2 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent1 to try and lynch a villager. Then, on Night 3, the werewolf (Agent2) killed Agent6. This means Agent2 must have seen Agent6 as a threat.\n\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent6 to try and deflect suspicion, and then killed Agent6 on Night 3. This means Agent5 is also a threat.\n\nAgent5's voting pattern has been very passive (NOONE), except for the vote on Agent6. This is quite suspicious. If Agent5 is trying to avoid detection, their sudden vote against Agent6 is odd, unless it's a deliberate misdirection.\n\nNow that Agent6 is dead, and knowing that Agent6 was a target of suspicion from Agent1 and myself (as Agent3), it means the werewolf is still active.\n\nWe have Agent2, Agent3, and Agent5 left.\nAgent2 voted for Agent1.\nAgent3 voted for Agent1 and then Agent6.\nAgent5 voted for Agent6.\n\nMy (Agent3's) actions: Voted for Agent1, then Agent6, then killed Agent6. This makes me look very suspicious now, as I was voting for people who were then eliminated.\n\nGiven Agent5's suspicious NOONE votes and then a sudden vote for Agent6, followed by Agent6's death, it points heavily towards Agent5 trying to manipulate the game. Agent5 is trying to appear as a neutral observer, but their actions are not consistent with a villager who is trying to solve the mystery.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

Before that, Agent6 was killed on Night 3.\n\nLet's recap the votes on Day 3, which led to Agent5's elimination:\nAgent2 voted for Agent5.\nAgent3 voted for Agent2.\n\nAgent5 voted NOONE.\n\nSo, Agent2 voted to eliminate Agent5, and I (Agent3) voted to eliminate Agent2. Agent5, for the first time, made a vote instead of abstaining, and they voted NOONE.\n\nNow Agent5 is dead. This means the werewolf was not Agent5. If Agent5 was a villager, they were trying to figure out who the werewolf was, and their vote for NOONE was a cautious move. If Agent5 was the werewolf, they would have been eliminated.\n\nThis leaves Agent2 and me (Agent3). We have both voted for each other. This means one of us is the werewolf.\n\nAgent5's vote for NOONE on Day 3 is now very telling. They were likely trying to avoid eliminating a villager, or they were trying to buy time. Their death means the werewolf was afraid of them or wanted to silence them.\n\nIf Agent2 is the werewolf, they voted for me (Agent3) to try and get me eliminated. If I am the werewolf, I voted for Agent2 to try and get them eliminated.\n\nLet's consider the previous actions. Agent2 voted for Agent1 on Day 2. Agent5 voted for Agent6 on Day 3. I (Agent3) voted for Agent1 on Day 2, and Agent2 on Day 3.\n\nThe fact that Agent5 was killed means the werewolf wanted them out. Agent5 was the one who previously voted NOONE. If Agent5 was a villager, then the werewolf is Agent2 or me.\n\nAgent2 voted for Agent5. If Agent2 is a villager, they correctly identified Agent5 as a threat, but Agent5 was killed by the werewolf on Night 4, which implies Agent2's vote was for a villager. This means Agent2 is likely the werewolf.\n\nMy vote for Agent2 on Day 3 was a strategic move to appear as a villager trying to solve the mystery.
