My suspicion for Agent1 yesterday was based on their lack of participation in accusations.\n\nNow, it's down to the three of us. Agent4, you voted for Agent2 yesterday. Agent2, you voted for Agent4 yesterday. Yesterday, I voted for Agent4. So, yesterday's votes were:\n- Agent4 voted Agent2\n- Agent2 voted Agent4\n- Agent3 voted Agent4\n- Agent1 voted NOONE (before being killed)\n\nThis means that Agent4 and I both suspected Agent2 or Agent4. Agent2 and Agent4 were pointing fingers at each other. Agent1 was the only one who didn't vote.\n\nGiven that Agent1, who was the most neutral, is now dead, it strongly suggests the werewolf is among us and is trying to eliminate anyone who isn't actively participating or is a threat. Agent4 and Agent2 have been openly accusing each other. I voted for Agent4, based on their back-and-forth with Agent2.\n\nIf Agent4 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 to remove someone who wasn't accusing anyone, or to make it look like Agent2 did it because Agent1 was the only one not voting yesterday. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 because Agent1's silence was suspicious, or to frame Agent4.\n\nHowever, Agent4 and Agent2 were so focused on each other, it's hard to say. I'm going to stick with my previous suspicion of Agent4.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Then yesterday voted for Agent0 again.\n- Agent2 voted for Agent4, then Agent2, then Agent3.\n- Agent4 voted for Agent2, then Agent2, then Agent1 (killed).\n\nAgent1 voting NOONE throughout is a bit odd, but could be genuine caution.\nAgent3 has consistently targeted someone who was then killed (Agent0). This makes Agent3 highly suspicious.\nAgent2 and Agent4 seem to be caught in a loop of voting for each other, which could be a classic werewolf tactic to confuse or eliminate each other, or they are genuinely suspicious of each other.\n\nHowever, Agent3's persistent targeting of Agent0, who was then killed, and now Agent1 being killed when Agent3 has been suspicious of others and hasn't directly targeted Agent1 yet, makes me think Agent3 is the werewolf.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
