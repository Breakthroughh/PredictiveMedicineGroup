Agent1 then voted for me.\n\nNow, Agent2 is dead. This means the werewolf killed Agent2 last night. Agent1 voted for me yesterday, so they were trying to eliminate me, a villager. This implies Agent1 is the werewolf. My strategy of observing was likely what they wanted to avoid, as a villager trying to deduce things would be a threat.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent5 has been consistently voting NOONE and observing, which is a safe strategy for a villager, but also a very good strategy for a werewolf who wants to avoid suspicion.\n\nGiven that Agent2 voted for me last night, they must have suspected me. If Agent5 is indeed the villager, they will likely see Agent2's vote against me as a genuine attempt to find the werewolf. If Agent5 is the werewolf, then Agent2's vote against me is also a good thing for them, as it diverts attention.\n\nThe fact that Agent5 voted NOONE last night, while Agent2 voted for me, means that Agent5 did not agree with Agent2's suspicion. This could be interpreted in two ways:\n1. Agent5 is a villager and genuinely believed Agent2 was wrong, or that there wasn't enough evidence to vote me.\n2. Agent5 is the werewolf and wanted to keep me alive to eliminate Agent2.\n\nHowever, it's now just me and Agent5. If Agent5 is the villager, they *should* be voting for me because I'm the only other person left and therefore must be the werewolf. If Agent5 is the werewolf, they *must* vote for me to win.\n\nMy previous vote for Agent5 was an attempt to deflect suspicion and have the werewolves (if any) eliminate someone else. Now, it's down to us. Agent5's consistent NOONE votes have kept them safe, but in a final two, that strategy is over. Agent5 has no one else to blame but me.\n\nI need to make a move that suggests I'm trying to win as a villager. If Agent5 is the villager, they will vote for me. If Agent5 is the werewolf, they will vote for me. Either way, the only logical conclusion for either player at this point is to vote for the other.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",
