They were very quick to analyze everyone else and tried to pinpoint Agent0. Agent3 has been consistently quiet, which can be a werewolf's tactic, but they also voted yesterday. Agent0's argument against Agent5 seemed reasonable.\n\nLet's re-examine. Agent1, who voted NOONE yesterday, is now dead. This means the werewolf acted. Agent5's analysis of Agent0 seems a bit forced. Agent3's rationale for voting Agent0 was based on their quietness, but Agent3 themselves has been very quiet.\n\nI'm still sticking with my earlier suspicion.
