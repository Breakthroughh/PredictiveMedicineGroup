      "content": "This is getting more complicated. Agent1 killed by the werewolf on Night 1, and now Agent0 is dead on Night 2. This suggests the werewolf is actively targeting people and trying to get rid of players who might be investigating.\n\nLet's look at the votes from the first day:\nAgent0 voted for me (Agent4).\nAgent2 voted for NOONE.\nAgent3 voted for Agent0.\n\nAnd my vote was NOONE.\n\nNow, Agent0 is dead. Agent0 was the one who voted for me. That could mean the werewolf was trying to silence me, or that Agent0 was trying to frame me by voting for me, and the werewolf then eliminated Agent0. It's also possible Agent0 was a villager who was trying to investigate and made a wrong guess, and the werewolf eliminated them for that reason.\n\nAgent3 voted for Agent0 on the first day. If Agent3 is a villager, they might have suspected Agent0 for some reason. If Agent3 is the werewolf, voting for Agent0 might be a way to deflect suspicion or eliminate a potential threat.\n\nAgent2 voted NOONE on the first day, which is a cautious approach. This could be a villager trying to gather more information, or a werewolf playing it safe.\n\nSince Agent0 is now dead, and they were the one who voted for me, I'm leaning away from suspecting myself as strongly. Agent3's vote for Agent0 on day 1 is interesting. If Agent3 was a villager, they might have had a reason to suspect Agent0. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they might have been trying to eliminate Agent0 preemptively or sow discord.\n\nAgent2 remains a bit of an unknown. Their \"NOONE\" vote on day 1 is neutral, and they haven't said much that gives me a strong read.\n\nConsidering Agent3 voted for Agent0 yesterday, and Agent0 was killed, it's a strange coincidence. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they might be trying to eliminate anyone who voted for them or anyone they perceive as a threat. However, Agent0 was the one who voted for me.\n\nI'm going to try and see what Agent2 and Agent3 say now. If Agent3 doubles down on suspicion or tries to point fingers in a suspicious way, it could be telling.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
