Agent4's initial assessment of Agent5's death as a \"standard werewolf move\" and their vote for Agent2 are points to consider. Agent2's consistent NOONE votes and lack of engagement could be a strategy to avoid suspicion.\n\nGiven the previous targeting of those asking questions, it might be strategic to focus on someone who is trying to stir up debate or is too actively investigating.
