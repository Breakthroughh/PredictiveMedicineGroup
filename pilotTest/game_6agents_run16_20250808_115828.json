I'm still Agent1, and my role is to deduce the werewolf. If Agent5 was the werewolf, then we've successfully eliminated the threat.\n\nNow, it's just Agent0, Agent3, and me. One of us is the werewolf. Agent4 was the first to specifically target someone (Agent5) and was then killed. Agent0 and Agent3, along with my own statement, all pointed to Agent5 after Agent4's death. This suggests that either Agent5 *was* the werewolf, or Agent4 was completely wrong and we collectively fell for a misdirection.\n\nI need to think about who was acting suspiciously before Agent4's death. Agent4 specifically called out Agent5. Agent0 and Agent3 seemed to go along with the suspicion on Agent5, but their earlier statements were very general. I myself was also general in my observations.\n\nGiven that Agent4 was eliminated after pointing suspicion at Agent5, and then Agent5 was eliminated by the group, if there is still a werewolf, it's either Agent0 or Agent3. I haven't seen anything truly suspicious from either of them yet, beyond the general observation phase.\n\nLet's consider this: if Agent5 *wasn't* the werewolf, then the werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent3. The werewolf would have wanted to eliminate Agent4 for being too observant or too close to the truth.\n\nHowever, the most direct suspicion was placed on Agent5, and the group voted for Agent5. If Agent5 was the werewolf, then the game is over and we've won. If Agent5 was NOT the werewolf, then the actual werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent3.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that Agent5 was NOT the werewolf. Agent4 was killed after calling out Agent5. This means the werewolf could be anyone, but specifically, the werewolf might have killed Agent4 to prevent further investigation into Agent5, or to frame Agent5 by making Agent4's accusation seem more credible. But if the werewolf was Agent0 or Agent3, why would they let Agent5 get lynched?\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation is that Agent5 was the werewolf, and we identified that correctly.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

If this is the case, then my goal is to eliminate one of them to secure a werewolf victory.\n\nAgent1 has been quite reserved, while Agent3 has been more vocal in their observations and accusations towards Agent5.

My own statements as Agent3 were also largely observational, and I did point suspicion at Agent5 when it seemed logical.\n\nIf Agent1 was killed by the werewolf, and the werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent3, then the werewolf is trying to eliminate the remaining villagers.\n\nConsidering that Agent1's last act was to state that the werewolf was likely Agent0 or Agent3, and then Agent1 was killed, it points very strongly to one of us being the werewolf.\n\nI have to assume Agent1's deduction was correct.
