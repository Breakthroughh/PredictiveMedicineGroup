Agent3's reasoning for voting for Agent5 was that Agent5 was consistently voting NOONE and not offering much, which Agent3 saw as blending in and a potential threat. I voted for Agent2 because their lack of contribution yesterday and Agent0's vote for them made me suspicious.\n\nNow, we have Agent2 and Agent3 left, besides myself. Agent2 is still focused on vague suspicions and pointing fingers at people who were \"quiet\" or \"too helpful.\" Agent3 has been very focused on passive play and observing, and yesterday they voted for Agent5, whom they suspected of blending in. Agent3's logic for voting for Agent5 felt a little flimsy, but they did take a shot.\n\nGiven that Agent5 is dead, and Agent3 voted for them yesterday, it means Agent3 was pointing to Agent5 as a potential werewolf. Agent2's vote yesterday was for me.\n\nThis is tough. Agent2's suspicion of me yesterday might have been a play. Agent3's suspicion of Agent5 might have been genuine, or a way to deflect from themselves. If Agent3 is the werewolf, voting for Agent5 would be a good way to get rid of a villager who was also suspicious of them. If Agent2 is the werewolf, voting for me yesterday was a direct attack.\n\nI'm going to reconsider my vote. Agent3's logic about Agent5 was that Agent5 was being too passive and blending in. This is a common werewolf tactic. Agent3 then voted for Agent5. If Agent3 *is* the werewolf, they might have voted for Agent5 to get rid of someone who was also being quiet, or even to look like a villager by pointing out a perceived threat.\n\nAgent2, on the other hand, has been consistently vague. Their vote for me yesterday, when they were also voting NOONE for others, is a red flag.\n\nLet's look at who *died*. Agent1, Agent0, Agent5. Agent0 voted for me. Agent5 voted for Agent2.\n\nAgent2 has been the most consistent with their \"gut feelings\" and trying to interpret behavior. Agent3 has been more analytical and observed behavior.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, their reasoning for voting for Agent5 yesterday seems plausible as a villager trying to uncover a threat.

Agent4 voted Agent2.\n\nNow, Agent5 is dead. Agent5 voted for me (Agent2) yesterday, which is interesting. Agent3 voted for Agent5, which is also interesting. Agent4 voted for me (Agent2) yesterday as well.\n\nSo, yesterday, Agent4 and Agent5 both pointed fingers at me. Agent3 pointed at Agent5.\n\nIf the werewolf is trying to eliminate the villagers, and Agent5 voted for me (Agent2), and Agent3 voted for Agent5, that leaves Agent4 as the only one who voted for me and didn't get targeted by someone else.\n\nHowever, let's think about who is *left*. Agent4, Agent2, Agent3. Agent5 is dead. Who killed Agent5?\n\nIf Agent4 is the werewolf, they might want to eliminate Agent2 and Agent3, who are the remaining active players. Agent3's vote for Agent5 could be a genuine villager trying to root out the threat.\n\nI still have my initial suspicions about Agent4's lack of substance yesterday. And Agent0's initial vote for Agent4.\n\nLet's reconsider the votes from yesterday:\nAgent5 -> Agent2\nAgent3 -> Agent5\nAgent2 -> Agent4\nAgent4 -> Agent2\n\nAgent5 is now dead. This means that whoever killed Agent5 was not voted out yesterday.\n\nIf Agent4 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent5 because Agent5 voted for Agent2, and Agent4 might want Agent2 gone to sow more confusion, or perhaps Agent5 was getting too close. But Agent4 also voted for Agent2. This is confusing.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, they killed Agent5 because Agent5 voted for Agent2, and Agent3 wants to protect Agent2 (or themselves) from being voted out. But Agent3 also voted for Agent5, which would point away from them.\n\nIf Agent2 is the werewolf, I would be killing off the villagers. Agent5 voted for me. Agent3 voted for Agent5. Agent4 voted for me. This fits. My aim is to eliminate the villagers.\n\nThe fact that Agent5 voted for me, and Agent4 voted for me, and Agent5 is now dead, makes me think. If the werewolf was trying to frame me, they might have gotten Agent5 killed to make it look like I was targeting people.\n\nHowever, Agent3's vote for Agent5 is also a significant piece of information. If Agent3 is a villager, they correctly identified a potential threat.\n\nI'm still suspicious of Agent4's initial passivity and the early vote against them by Agent0.\n\nLet's look at who is left and who voted for whom yesterday:\nAgent4 (who was voted for by Agent0, and voted for me yesterday)\nAgent2 (who was voted for by Agent5 and Agent4 yesterday)\nAgent3 (who voted for Agent5 yesterday)\n\nIf Agent4 is the werewolf, they are trying to eliminate me and Agent3. Their vote for me is consistent with this. Agent3's vote for Agent5 is a problem for this theory, unless Agent3 is bluffing or genuinely misidentified.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, they are trying to eliminate Agent2 and Agent4. Their vote for Agent5 is a problem for this theory too.\n\nIf I am the werewolf (Agent2), I am trying to eliminate Agent4 and Agent3. My vote for Agent4 yesterday fits. Agent5 voting for me and Agent4 voting for me could be villagers correctly identifying me. But if I am the werewolf, I need to make sure Agent3 doesn't vote for me.\n\nAgent3 has been very quiet and observational. Their vote for Agent5 yesterday is the only strong action they've taken.\n\nGiven that Agent5 is dead, and Agent3 voted for Agent5, it's possible Agent3 is a villager who correctly identified a threat. Agent4 voted for me yesterday, and I voted for Agent4. Agent5 voted for me.\n\nThis makes me lean away from Agent4 being the werewolf, as their actions seem to be directly targeting me. If they were the werewolf, they'd want to eliminate the other villagers too.\n\nI'm going to stick with my earlier suspicion.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

Agent4's insistence that Agent2 is deflecting, while Agent2 is pointing at Agent4 and also me for being too quiet (which is rich coming from them!), is making me think Agent4 might be the more strategic player here. They're trying to create a narrative. Agent2's vote for Agent4 also seems a bit pointed.\n\nGiven that Agent4 was the target of Agent0's vote initially, and now Agent2 and Agent4 are openly accusing each other, I think Agent4 is the most suspicious. They're actively trying to misdirect.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",
