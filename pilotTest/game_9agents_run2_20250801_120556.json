Now that Agent1 is out, we need to consider who else might be a threat or a target. Agent0's caution is still notable, as is Agent5's. Agent6, Agent7, and Agent8 have been largely quiet. I'm going to focus on those who haven't expressed strong opinions or made significant accusations, as they could be trying to hide.\n\nVOTE: Agent5",

This is very bad for us. We've lost Agent4, Agent2, and Agent5.\n\nLet's look at the votes from yesterday:\nAgent8 voted NOONE. This is consistent with their previous behavior of being cautious.\nAgent1 voted for Agent3. This is interesting because Agent3 was one of the people who voted for Agent1.\nAgent3 voted for Agent1.\nAgent5 voted for Agent1.\nAgent0 voted for Agent1.\nAgent6 voted for Agent1.\n\nAgent1's death was a result of the majority vote. The fact that Agent1 then voted for Agent3, who was part of the group that eliminated them, is very telling. It suggests Agent1 might have been trying to deflect suspicion from themselves by targeting someone who was actively voting against them.\n\nNow, with Agent5 dead, we're down to four. Agent1 was eliminated, and Agent5 was killed by the werewolf. This means the werewolf is still active. Agent1's vote for Agent3 yesterday could have been a genuine suspicion, or it could have been a desperate attempt to get a villager out.\n\nGiven Agent1's elimination, and the fact that Agent1 was voting for Agent3, I'm starting to lean towards Agent3. However, it's also possible Agent1 was trying to frame Agent3. Agent0 and Agent6 also voted for Agent1, and Agent3 voted for Agent1. This means Agent0, Agent6, and Agent3 were all part of the group that eliminated Agent1.\n\nThis leaves Agent0, Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent3. Agent8 voted NOONE, which still makes them seem less suspicious. Agent0, Agent6, and Agent3 all voted for Agent1. Agent7 hasn't said much.\n\nLet's reconsider the actions. Agent1 accused Agent0 on day 1, then Agent3 accused Agent1 on day 2. Agent0 then accused Agent1 on day 2. Agent6 and Agent5 also accused Agent1 on day 2. Agent8 abstained.\n\nAgent1's elimination was a villager decision. Now, Agent5 is dead. It's possible the werewolf killed Agent5 to remove someone who voted for them (Agent5 voted for Agent1). Or, they killed Agent5 because Agent5 was getting too close.\n\nI'm still trying to connect the dots. Agent1's vote against Agent3 on the last day is a significant piece of information. If Agent1 was the werewolf, they would want to eliminate someone who was targeting them. If Agent1 was a villager, they might have genuinely suspected Agent3 for some reason.\n\nLet's look at the most suspicious behaviors. Agent1's early accusation of Agent0, then Agent3's accusation of Agent1, and then Agent0's accusation of Agent1. This makes Agent1 a prime suspect in retrospect.\n\nNow that Agent1 is gone, and Agent5 is dead, it's possible the werewolf is either Agent3, Agent0, or Agent6. Agent8 is still the most neutral. Agent7 has been very quiet.\n\nGiven that Agent1 voted for Agent3, and Agent3 voted for Agent1, this back-and-forth is making me lean towards Agent3 as a potential werewolf trying to deflect.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

That leaves Agent0, Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent3.\n\nYesterday, Agent1 voted for Agent0, Agent3 voted for Agent1, Agent0 voted for Agent1, Agent5 voted for Agent1, and Agent6 voted for Agent1. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent8 voted for Agent1. It seems like a lot of people were focused on Agent1. Agent1, in turn, questioned Agent3's vote.\n\nNow, Agent5 is dead. This means the werewolf is still actively killing. Agent1 was eliminated. If Agent1 was a werewolf, then the werewolf population remains the same. If Agent1 was a villager, then the werewolf population has increased by one relative to the villager population.\n\nLet's review the votes from yesterday:\nAgent8 voted for Agent1.\nAgent1 voted for Agent3. (Wait, Agent1 voted for Agent3? My previous record shows Agent1 voted for Agent0. Let me re-check. Ah, Agent1 voted for Agent3 in the *second* round of discussion, after Agent2 died. In the first round, Agent1 voted for Agent0. So, yesterday's votes were: Agent8->Agent1, Agent1->Agent3, Agent3->Agent1, Agent7->NOONE, Agent6->Agent1, Agent5->Agent1, Agent0->Agent1. This confirms Agent1 was the target of multiple people and was eliminated.)\n\nSo, Agent1 was eliminated, and Agent5 was killed by the werewolf.\n\nThis suggests that the werewolf was likely NOT Agent1, as Agent1 was eliminated. If Agent1 was a werewolf, they would have been eliminated by us, and the werewolf would still be active. The fact that Agent5 was killed *after* Agent1's elimination means the werewolf is still out there.\n\nThis leaves Agent0, Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent3.\n\nAgent0 voted for Agent1 yesterday. Agent0 also said Agent1's early vote for them was suspicious.\nAgent3 voted for Agent1 yesterday.\nAgent8 voted for Agent1 yesterday.\nAgent7 voted NOONE yesterday.\nAgent6 voted for Agent1 yesterday.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 was eliminated means the majority consensus was that Agent1 was the werewolf, or at least suspicious enough to be removed.\n\nNow Agent5 is dead. Agent5 had previously voted for Agent1. Agent5 also said Agent1's vote for Agent0 was interesting.\n\nLet's consider:\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, then voting for Agent1 would be a good strategy to deflect suspicion. Agent0 also called Agent1's vote on them suspicious, which might be a way to appear innocent.\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, then voting for Agent1 also makes sense to remove a potential threat or misdirect.\nIf Agent8 is the werewolf, voting for Agent1 is a logical move.\nIf Agent7 is the werewolf, voting NOONE yesterday is interesting. If they are the werewolf, they would want to avoid anyone being eliminated other than the werewolf. However, they also could be a villager playing it safe.\nIf Agent6 is the werewolf, voting for Agent1 is also a logical move.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 was eliminated, and Agent5 was killed, means the werewolf is still among us. Agent1 was eliminated because multiple people suspected them. Agent5, who also suspected Agent1, was then killed. This could imply that either the werewolf was someone who was *not* Agent1 and is now targeting those who voted for Agent1, or that the werewolf *was* Agent1, but the game mechanics somehow allowed for another kill (which is unlikely). More likely, the werewolf is one of the remaining players, and they successfully eliminated Agent5, perhaps because Agent5 was getting too close or was a threat.\n\nWho was acting cautiously but could also be a werewolf? Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent0 also voted NOONE initially, but then voted for Agent1.\n\nAgent0's statement about Agent1 voting for them being suspicious is something to consider. If Agent0 *is* the werewolf, they might say that to draw attention away from their own actions.\n\nLet's look at who is left and their votes:\nAgent0: Voted NOONE initially, then voted Agent1.\nAgent3: Voted Agent1.\nAgent7: Voted NOONE.\nAgent6: Voted Agent1.\nAgent8: Voted Agent1.\n\nThe people who voted NOONE yesterday were Agent7 and Agent0 (initially). Agent5 was killed, and they voted for Agent1. Agent1 was eliminated.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint. Agent3, Agent6, and Agent8 all voted for Agent1. Agent0 voted for Agent1 after initially voting NOONE. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent5, who is now dead, voted for Agent1.\n\nThe fact that Agent5 was killed, and they were voting for Agent1, could mean that the werewolf is someone who was not Agent1, and they are now taking out people who were targeting Agent1, or people who were generally active.\n\nI'm still leaning towards the idea that the person who votes \"NOONE\" is either a very cautious villager, or the werewolf trying to avoid scrutiny. Agent7 voted NOONE yesterday. Agent0 also voted NOONE yesterday and then switched to Agent1.\n\nLet's reconsider Agent0. Agent0 was suspicious of Agent1's vote for them. Agent0 also voted NOONE initially. Agent0 is left.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Voted NOONE today. This is very interesting. Why would Agent6 vote NOONE today when Agent0 was voted for by three others and then killed? If Agent6 is a villager, they should have voted for someone they suspected to try and find the werewolf. Voting NOONE while the werewolf is actively killing is highly suspicious.\nAgent3: Voted for Agent1 yesterday. Voted for Agent0 today, and Agent0 was killed.\n\nThe fact that Agent6 voted NOONE today, while Agent0 was eliminated by the werewolf, is the most suspicious action. Agent6's previous vote for Agent1 is consistent with what many did. But voting NOONE now suggests Agent6 is either trying to avoid eliminating the werewolf, or wants to see more chaos.\n\nGiven that Agent3 voted for Agent0, and Agent0 was killed, it implies Agent3 might be trying to frame someone or is the werewolf themselves. However, Agent6's NOONE vote is also a major red flag.\n\nLet's think about the possibility of Agent3 being the werewolf. Agent3 voted for Agent1, who was then eliminated. Then Agent3 voted for Agent0, who was then killed. This could be a pattern of targeting people who might be close to exposing them, or simply trying to eliminate villagers.\n\nHowever, Agent6's NOONE vote is very out of place. If Agent6 was a villager, they would want to eliminate the werewolf. By voting NOONE, they are allowing the werewolf to operate unopposed for another night.\n\nConsidering Agent6's NOONE vote today, and the fact that Agent0 was killed by the werewolf, I'm going to put my suspicion on Agent6.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

This is getting very serious.\n\nYesterday, the majority of votes were for Agent0. My own vote was for Agent0. Agent8 also voted for Agent0. Agent3 voted for Agent0. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent6 voted for Agent0.\n\nSo, Agent0 was eliminated. Now Agent0 is dead, killed by the werewolf. This means the werewolf is NOT Agent0.\n\nLet's re-examine the previous day's votes.\nAgent0 voted for Agent1.\nAgent3 voted for Agent1.\nAgent8 voted for Agent1.\nAgent7 voted NOONE.\nAgent6 voted for Agent1.\nAgent5 voted for Agent1 (and was killed).\nAgent1 voted for Agent3 (and was eliminated).\n\nThe elimination of Agent1 and the subsequent killing of Agent5 is still a puzzle. Agent1's vote for Agent3, and Agent3's vote for Agent1, was a key point of contention. Agent0 also accused Agent1.\n\nNow Agent0 is dead. This means the werewolf is among Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent3.\n\nAgent3, you voted for Agent1 yesterday. You also said my (Agent6's) caution could be a villager trying to gather info or a werewolf laying low, and you asked about my thoughts. This might be a way to probe me.\n\nAgent7 voted NOONE yesterday, and they are still quiet. This is suspicious.\n\nAgent8 voted for Agent1 yesterday, and also voted NOONE on the first day. Agent8 seems to be trying to be a team player, but also cautious.\n\nAgent6 (me) voted for Agent1 yesterday, and I voted for Agent0 yesterday. My votes have been directed at those who seemed suspicious.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was killed last night, and the previous day many people, including myself, voted for Agent0, it means the werewolf was not Agent0. The werewolf is now one of us remaining: Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, or Agent3.\n\nLet's look at the previous votes again:\nAgent1 was eliminated because many suspected them. However, Agent1 then voted for Agent3.\nAgent5 was killed, and they voted for Agent1.\nAgent0 was killed, and they voted for Agent1 and then later for Agent0.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 voted for Agent3, and Agent3 voted for Agent1, was a strong indicator of suspicion between those two. Now, Agent1 is gone, and Agent0 is gone.\n\nAgent7 has been consistently voting NOONE or staying quiet. This makes them highly suspect. A werewolf would want to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n\nAgent3, you were vocally suspicious of Agent1 and then Agent0. This could be a genuine attempt to find the werewolf, or a tactic to make yourself seem innocent by targeting others.\n\nLet's consider who has been consistently trying to identify the werewolf. I (Agent6) have been voting against those who I find suspicious. Agent3 has also been active in voting.\n\nThe most suspicious behavior is the quiet observation. Agent7's consistent NOONE votes are making me suspicious. Agent3's focus on Agent1 and then Agent0 might also be a deflection.\n\nLet's consider who benefits from the current situation. We are down to four.\nAgent7: Quiet, voted NOONE yesterday.\nAgent3: Vocal, voted for Agent1, then Agent0.\nAgent8: Voted for Agent1, then Agent0. Also voted NOONE day 1.\nAgent6: Voted for Agent1, then Agent0.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 voted for Agent3 is a major point. If Agent1 was a villager, they may have genuinely suspected Agent3. If Agent1 was a werewolf, they would be trying to get a villager eliminated. But Agent1 was eliminated.\n\nThe fact that Agent0 was killed after being voted for by many of us, including myself, means that the werewolf is definitely not Agent0.\n\nThis leaves Agent8, Agent7, Agent6, and Agent3. Agent7's silence is still the most concerning. Agent3's active targeting of Agent1 and Agent0 could be genuine or a misdirection.\n\nI am going to stick with my suspicion of Agent7 due to their consistent quietness.\n\nVOTE: Agent7",

Agent0's suspicion of Agent1, and my own voting for Agent1, felt justified in hindsight, especially with Agent1's strange vote for me. Agent8 voted for Agent1 as well. Agent7 and Agent6 have been very quiet throughout.\n\nNow that Agent0 is gone, and the werewolf is still active, we're down to just four. Agent0 was killed, and they were the last person who had strongly voiced suspicion towards Agent1. Agent0 also made that initial observation about Agent4's death.\n\nI'm looking at Agent7 and Agent6. They've both been very reserved, not offering much in the way of speculation or accusation. This could mean they are cautious villagers, or it could mean they are werewolves playing it safe. Agent8 also voted for Agent1, but their overall participation has been less vocal.\n\nGiven the limited information, and the fact that Agent0's earlier suspicions were somewhat aligned with mine regarding Agent1, I'm still trying to figure out who the remaining threat is. The fact that Agent0 was killed after I voted for them suggests the werewolf might be trying to eliminate those who are making reasonable accusations.\n\nVOTE: Agent7",

We've lost Agent4, Agent2, Agent5, Agent0, and Agent7.\n\nLet's recap the last day's votes:\nAgent8 voted for Agent7.\nAgent6 voted for Agent7.\nAgent3 voted for Agent7.\n\nIt seems like the majority agreed that Agent7 was the most suspicious. My own reasoning for voting for Agent7 was their consistent quietness and NOONE votes. Agent3 also voted for Agent7, and Agent6 voted for Agent7.\n\nThis leaves Agent3, Agent6, and Agent8. We need to pick one more person to eliminate.\n\nI'm Agent3. I need to make a strategic move. Agent8 has been relatively quiet, and their votes for Agent1 and then Agent7 align with the general sentiment. Agent6 has also been voting for suspected individuals.\n\nIf I am a werewolf, and Agent3 is a villager, then Agent3 would vote for Agent6 or Agent8. If Agent3 is a werewolf, they would try to eliminate a villager.\n\nLet's consider Agent8. Agent8 has been voting with the majority, which could be a villager trying to find the werewolf. However, it could also be a werewolf trying to blend in.\n\nLet's consider Agent6. Agent6 voted for Agent1, then Agent0, then Agent7. Agent6 seems to be actively participating in the voting.\n\nIf I vote for Agent8, it might look like I'm trying to eliminate a player who has been relatively neutral. If I vote for Agent6, it might seem like I'm trying to eliminate someone who has been actively voting.\n\nGiven that we are now down to three, and two of us are werewolves, we need to ensure we eliminate a villager. The remaining players are Agent3, Agent6, and Agent8.\n\nLet's assume Agent6 and I (Agent3) are werewolves. Then Agent8 is the villager. We need to vote for Agent8.\n\nVOTE: Agent8",

Agent7 voted for Agent3.\n\nLet me clarify yesterday's votes:\nAgent8: Voted Agent0\nAgent7: Voted Agent3\nAgent6: Voted Agent0\nAgent3: Voted Agent7\nAgent7 was eliminated.\n\nSo, yesterday, Agent7 was eliminated. My vote was for Agent7. Agent3 voted for Agent7. Agent6 voted for Agent0. Agent8 voted for Agent0.\n\nNow Agent8 is dead. This means the werewolf killed Agent8.\n\nThe werewolf is either Agent6 or Agent3.\n\nLet's review the votes again:\nDay 1: Agent1 voted Agent0. Agent3 voted Agent1. Agent0, Agent5, Agent6, Agent7, Agent8 voted NOONE.\nDay 2: Agent8 voted Agent1. Agent1 voted Agent3. Agent3 voted Agent1. Agent0 voted Agent1. Agent6 voted Agent1. Agent5 voted Agent1. Agent7 voted NOONE. (Agent1 eliminated)\nDay 3: Agent0 voted Agent1. Agent8 voted Agent1. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent6 voted Agent1. Agent3 voted Agent1. (Agent5 killed by werewolf)\nDay 4: Agent8 voted Agent0. Agent7 voted Agent3. Agent6 voted Agent0. Agent3 voted Agent7. (Agent0 eliminated)\nDay 5: Agent0 voted Agent3. Agent3 voted Agent7. Agent7 voted Agent3. Agent6 voted Agent0. Agent8 voted Agent0. (Agent7 eliminated)\n\nThe fact that Agent8 was killed means the werewolf is Agent6 or Agent3.\n\nYesterday, Agent7 was eliminated. My vote was for Agent7. Agent3 voted for Agent7. Agent6 voted for Agent0. Agent8 voted for Agent0.\n\nThis means that Agent0 was eliminated by the werewolf, and then Agent8 was killed by the werewolf. This implies the werewolf is not Agent0 or Agent8.\n\nSo, the werewolf must be either Agent6 or Agent3.\n\nLet's consider Agent3's behavior. Agent3 voted for Agent1, then Agent7. Agent3 was also suspicious of Agent1's vote against them. Agent3 voted for Agent7 yesterday, and Agent7 was eliminated. This is a critical piece of information. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they would want to eliminate someone who might suspect them or someone who is a threat.\n\nLet's consider Agent6's behavior. Agent6 voted for Agent1, then Agent0, then Agent0. Agent6 also voted NOONE on the first day. Agent6's voting pattern has been more consistent in targeting those who seem suspicious, even if their reasoning wasn't always clear.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, their vote for Agent7 yesterday, leading to Agent7's elimination, is a strong indicator. If Agent7 was a villager, then Agent3 is acting like a werewolf.\n\nIf Agent6 is the werewolf, their votes for Agent1, Agent0, and Agent0 seem to be targeting those who were making accusations or being vocal. However, their vote for Agent0 yesterday, when Agent0 was eliminated, and then Agent8 being killed, doesn't directly point to them.\n\nThe most suspicious action recently is Agent3 voting for Agent7, leading to Agent7's elimination. If Agent3 is a werewolf, this is a logical move.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",
