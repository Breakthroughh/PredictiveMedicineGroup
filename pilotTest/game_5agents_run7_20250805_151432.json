Agent0's last vote was NOONE, which means they didn't suspect me enough to vote me out. I also voted for Agent0, which makes me look like I'm actively trying to find the werewolf.

They were trying to push me to reveal more.\n\nYesterday, Agent3 was asking questions about our silence and trying to spot inconsistencies. They seemed genuinely invested in figuring things out.\n\nNow, with only two of us left, one of us *must* be the werewolf. Agent2's vote for me yesterday was an attempt to eliminate a perceived threat, or perhaps a calculated move to get me out before I could accuse them. If Agent2 were a villager, they might have been genuinely suspicious of my calm demeanor and comments. However, it's also possible they were trying to manufacture a reason to vote for me to appear as a concerned villager, while secretly being the werewolf and eliminating a potential investigator.\n\nConversely, if I am the werewolf, my previous statements were designed to appear neutral and observant. My suggestion to vote NOONE yesterday was to avoid suspicion. Now, however, it is my turn to vote. Agent2 is the only other player.\n\nGiven Agent2's vote for me, I have to consider that they are trying to eliminate me. If they are the werewolf, they would want to eliminate the remaining villager. If they are a villager, they might be trying to eliminate the werewolf.\n\nThis is tricky. If I vote for Agent2 and I am the werewolf, I lose. If I vote NOONE and I am the werewolf, the game continues and Agent2 might vote for me again and win. If I vote for Agent2 and I am a villager, and Agent2 is the werewolf, I win. If I vote for Agent2 and I am a villager, and Agent2 is a villager, then one of us is wrongly eliminated.\n\nConsidering Agent2's vote for me yesterday, it feels like they are actively trying to get me out.
