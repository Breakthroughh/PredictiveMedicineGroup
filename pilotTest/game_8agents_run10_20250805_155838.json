Agent0 specifically asked Agent4 for new insights and Agent2 for their thoughts. Agent2's response was also cautious, saying they were going to listen.\n\nNow, Agent0 is dead. Agent0 voted for Agent4 on Day 1. This could be a distraction, or it could be that Agent0 genuinely suspected Agent4. If the werewolf killed Agent0 because Agent0 suspected them, it's possible Agent0 was indeed onto something with Agent4.\n\nHowever, Agent2 and Agent1 were also very reserved on Day 1.
