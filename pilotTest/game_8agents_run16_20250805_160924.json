Agent4 seemed to agree with Agent0's assessment of Agent3 yesterday, but then voted for Agent2.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint the werewolf with so many dead. Agent2's actions were a bit all over the place. I'm still not entirely convinced about Agent3's silence, but the fact that Agent0 and Agent2 were both killed after focusing on Agent3 could be a strong indicator. Or, they could be framing Agent3.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

This strongly suggests Agent3 is the werewolf, and Agent2's accusation was accurate enough to warrant elimination. Agent2's own vote for Agent7 yesterday now seems like a misdirection. Agent5 voting for Agent2 yesterday also aligns with this thinking, though Agent5's reasoning was a bit vague. Agent4's reasoning that the werewolf agreed with their assessment of Agent0 is faulty logic; Agent0 was the one accusing Agent3.

      "content": "Agent1 was killed last night. This is incredibly frustrating. Agent3 was eliminated yesterday, and my immediate suspicion was on them. Now, Agent1 is gone. Agent1 was very focused on Agent3, and Agent1's logic seemed sound. If Agent3 was the werewolf, why would Agent1 be targeted? This suggests that either Agent3 wasn't the werewolf, or the werewolf is trying to eliminate anyone who is a strong player and can accurately identify them.\n\nLooking back, Agent0 was killed after accusing Agent3. Agent2 was killed after voting for Agent3. Agent3 was killed after being accused by Agent1 and others. And now Agent1, who was strongly accusing Agent3, is dead. This pattern is confusing.\n\nIf Agent3 was the werewolf, then Agent0, Agent2, and Agent1 were all eliminated for being too close to the truth. However, the fact that Agent3 was eliminated yesterday means that the *town* successfully identified the werewolf (or so we thought). If Agent3 was the werewolf, and the town voted them out, then the werewolf is no longer in play. But we just lost Agent1 last night. This means the werewolf is still alive.\n\nThis implies Agent3 was NOT the werewolf. Agent3 was likely a townsperson who was correctly suspected, but the werewolf is someone else who eliminated Agent1 to throw us off.\n\nAgent7, your initial strategy was to look at loud or deflective people. You voted NOONE twice, then voted for Agent3. Agent4 was also playing cautiously, voting NOONE, then for Agent2. Agent5 was also cautious, voting NOONE, then for Agent2.\n\nIf Agent3 was wrongly accused, then Agent1's strong push against them could have made Agent1 a target. Agent7 and Agent4's votes for Agent2 yesterday could have been genuine, or a diversion. Agent5's vote for Agent2 yesterday also.\n\nGiven that Agent3 is out, and Agent1 is now dead, the focus has to shift. Agent5 and Agent4 both voted for Agent2 yesterday. Agent7 voted NOONE yesterday. Agent1 voted for Agent3 yesterday.\n\nThis implies Agent2 was a strong suspect for Agent5 and Agent4. Agent7 was still cautious. Agent1 was focused on Agent3.\n\nIf Agent3 was innocent, then the werewolf is among Agent4, Agent5, and Agent7. Agent7's initial \"gut instinct\" comment, followed by voting NOONE, then voting for Agent3, and then voting NOONE again, is quite a neutral stance. Agent4 and Agent5 seem to have converged on voting for Agent2 at one point.\n\nI am still Agent7. I need to re-evaluate. Agent1 was a strong accuser and is now dead. This means the werewolf is still active. The fact that Agent3 was eliminated yesterday might have been a red herring, or the werewolf is very good at framing.\n\nI am going to trust my initial assessment that the werewolf is often loud or deflective. Agent5's \"This is getting serious\" and the follow-up about Agent0 focusing on Agent3, and then Agent2 voting for Agent7, felt a little bit like they were trying to establish a narrative. Agent4 also had a very specific logic about their vote for Agent0.\n\nThis is tough. If Agent3 was wrongly eliminated, then Agent1 was a victim. But if Agent1 was a victim of the werewolf, then the werewolf is one of the remaining three.\n\nLet's assume Agent3 was indeed the werewolf, and the town correctly eliminated them yesterday. That means the werewolf is no longer here. But then Agent1 was killed last night, which contradicts that. Therefore, Agent3 was NOT the werewolf.\n\nThis means the werewolf is among Agent4, Agent5, and Agent7. Agent1 was eliminated because they were getting too close. Agent1 was very strong in their accusations against Agent3. Now that Agent3 is gone, Agent1 is gone. This points to the werewolf being someone who was perhaps being framed by Agent1's accusations, or someone who wanted to eliminate a strong town player.\n\nAgent4 and Agent5 both voted for Agent2 yesterday. Agent7 voted NOONE. This suggests Agent4 and Agent5 might be working together or have a similar assessment of threats. Agent7's silence and then vote for Agent3, then NOONE, is hard to read.\n\nI need to consider who benefits from Agent1's death. Agent1 was strongly pushing Agent3. If Agent3 was innocent, then the werewolf would want to eliminate Agent1.\n\nLet's consider who has been most consistently neutral or evasive, or who made a suspicious move. My own vote for Agent7 yesterday was based on a feeling, which is not strong evidence. Agent2's actions were erratic.\n\nAgent5 and Agent4 have been relatively consistent in their caution and then targeting Agent2. Agent7 has been very quiet.\n\nI am Agent7. My initial assessment was to look at loud or deflective people. Agent5's statements felt a little too explanatory, trying to recap events. Agent4's logic also felt a bit constructed. Agent7's silence is also a form of play.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was a strong accuser and is now eliminated, and Agent3 was eliminated yesterday, this suggests Agent3 might have been a decoy, or the werewolf is extremely skilled.\n\nIf Agent3 was innocent, then Agent1 was a victim. Agent1 was accusing Agent3. Who would want Agent1 gone if Agent1 was accusing Agent3? Someone who Agent1 *wasn't* accusing, or someone who Agent1 was wrongly accusing.\n\nThis is a difficult situation. I will re-evaluate based on past actions.\n\nAgent4 and Agent5 both voted for Agent2 yesterday. Agent7 voted NOONE. Agent1 voted for Agent3. Agent3 was eliminated.\n\nIf Agent3 was innocent, then Agent1 was a victim for accusing them. If Agent1 was a victim, then the werewolf is among Agent4, Agent5, and Agent7.\n\nAgent5's statements have been a bit too much of a summary. Agent4's reasoning for their votes also seems a bit too neat. Agent7 has been quiet, which can be a good or bad thing.\n\nI think the most likely scenario is that Agent3 was innocent and the werewolf eliminated Agent1. Agent5 and Agent4 both targeted Agent2 yesterday. Agent7 remained neutral.\n\nI'm going to trust that Agent2 was a target for multiple people, and Agent7's neutrality is more suspicious than Agent4 or Agent5's focused vote.\n\nVOTE: Agent7",
