Agent1 was the only one to vote for someone (me) on Day 1, which I found suspicious. After that, Agent1 abstained from voting.\n\nNow, let's look at the other votes. On Day 1, only Agent1 voted for someone. Everyone else (Agent3, Agent0, Agent6, Agent2, Agent5) voted NOONE. On Day 2, I (Agent0) voted for Agent1. Agent6 voted for Agent1. Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 voted NOONE. Agent1 also voted NOONE on Day 2.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 targeted me initially, and then other people like Agent6 and myself targeted Agent1, suggests a potential pattern. Agent1's death last night is proof that the werewolf is still out there.\n\nConsidering Agent1's initial accusation of me on Day 1, and then the fact that Agent1 became a target for others, it's possible Agent1 was trying to manipulate the game. However, their death also means they could have been a villager trying to survive.\n\nThe people who consistently voted NOONE are Agent3, Agent2, and Agent5. This could mean they are being cautious, or they are the werewolf trying to avoid drawing attention. Agent6 also voted NOONE on Day 1 and then voted for Agent1 on Day 2, which aligns with me.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was killed, and Agent1 was the only one to make an accusation on Day 1, and then Agent1 was accused by others on Day 2, it's a bit of a confusing situation. However, the fact that Agent1 was killed *after* being accused by multiple people makes it less likely that Agent1 was the werewolf, as the werewolf would likely be trying to avoid being lynched.\n\nLet's reconsider Agent1's Day 1 vote. They voted for me. I responded by saying they were deflecting. Then on Day 2, Agent6 and I both voted for Agent1. Agent1 voted NOONE. Agent1's final statement on Day 2 was quite passive.\n\nThe fact that Agent1 was killed suggests the werewolf is actively eliminating people. My vote for Agent1 on Day 2 was based on their suspicious initial vote. Agent6's vote for Agent1 was similar. Agent1's death means we now have to re-evaluate.\n\nWhat if Agent1 was a villager who was wrongly accused and then killed? The werewolf would want that. Or what if Agent1 *was* the werewolf and was killed by the other werewolf? That's also possible.\n\nLet's look at who is left and who has been consistent. Agent3, Agent2, and Agent5 have consistently voted NOONE. This is either extreme caution or an attempt to hide. Agent6 and I have been more active in trying to identify someone.\n\nGiven Agent1's initial accusation against me, and my counter-accusation, it's possible one of us is the werewolf. But with Agent1 dead, it complicates things.\n\nIf the werewolf killed Agent1, then the remaining players (Agent3, Agent0, Agent6, Agent5, Agent2) need to figure out who the werewolf is among them. The people who have been quiet (Agent3, Agent2, Agent5) are my main suspects for being the werewolf, as they haven't given any concrete reasons for their NOONE votes. Agent6 and I have been more vocal.\n\nI need to consider who would benefit most from Agent1's death. Agent1 was the only accuser on Day 1, and then became the accused. It's a bit of a mess.\n\nHowever, if the werewolf wanted to frame someone, accusing me and then getting killed by the *real* werewolf wouldn't be a bad play for the werewolf.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the quiet players are the wolves. Agent3, Agent2, and Agent5. If one of them is the werewolf, their strategy of voting NOONE would make sense. Agent6 and I have been trying to actively find the wolf.\n\nI'm going to stick with my earlier assessment that the quiet players are more suspect. Agent3, Agent2, and Agent5 have shown no willingness to commit to an accusation.\n\nVOTE: Agent3",

Agent1 was the only one to vote for a player (Agent0) in the first round, and then Agent0, Agent6, Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 all voted for Agent1 yesterday. Agent0, Agent6, Agent5, and Agent2 all called out Agent1's early vote for Agent0 as suspicious. Agent1 defended their vote by saying Agent0's reaction was \"odd,\" but then pivoted to saying Agent0's response was \"reasonable\" and that they were \"keeping an eye on\" everyone. Agent1's final vote was NOONE, which is confusing after their earlier accusations.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was the one actively pushing an accusation early on, and then became the target of most people's suspicion, it feels like Agent1 could have been trying to deflect. However, Agent0, Agent6, Agent5, and Agent2 all saw Agent1's initial move as suspicious and voted for them. This suggests a general consensus that Agent1 was acting strangely.\n\nNow that Agent1 is dead, we have Agent0, Agent6, Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 left. Agent0, Agent6, Agent5, and Agent2 all seemed to agree that Agent1's behavior was suspicious. I'm still trying to put the pieces together.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 all voted NOONE on Day 2. Agent6 also voted for Agent1 on Day 2.\n\nSo, on Day 2:\nAgent1 voted NOONE\nAgent0 voted Agent1\nAgent6 voted Agent1\nAgent3 voted NOONE\nAgent5 voted NOONE\nAgent2 voted NOONE\n\nThis means Agent0 and Agent6 both suspected Agent1 on Day 2. Agent1's death last night, after being accused by Agent0 and Agent6, is a strong indicator. If the werewolf wanted Agent1 gone, this would make sense. Agent1 was perhaps being too vocal or making too many enemies.\n\nAgent0, you correctly identified Agent1 as a potential threat by voting for them. Agent6, you also voted for Agent1. Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 were all hesitant to vote, which could mean they are genuinely trying to figure things out or they are the werewolf trying to avoid suspicion.\n\nGiven that Agent1 was killed, and Agent0 and Agent6 were the ones who pinpointed Agent1 yesterday, it's highly probable that the werewolf is someone who wanted Agent1 silenced. This could be Agent3, Agent5, or Agent2, who remained silent.\n\nHowever, let's consider Agent0 and Agent6. If one of them is the werewolf, they might have voted for Agent1 to throw off suspicion from themselves, knowing Agent1 was a target of the other. But Agent1 died last night. If Agent0 or Agent6 were the werewolf, why wouldn't they have killed Agent3, Agent5, or Agent2 instead of Agent1 who was already under scrutiny? It makes more sense that the werewolf is among those who *didn't* vote for Agent1 yesterday.\n\nAgent3, Agent5, and Agent2. Agent3 has been asking questions and seems like a villager. Agent5 and Agent2 have been very quiet, playing it safe. This extreme caution can sometimes be a werewolf tactic to avoid drawing attention.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the Day 2 votes:\nAgent1 voted NOONE\nAgent0 voted Agent1\nAgent6 voted Agent1\nAgent3 voted NOONE\nAgent5 voted NOONE\nAgent2 voted NOONE\n\nAgent1, Agent0, and Agent6 were the active voters. Agent1 was killed. If the werewolf was Agent0 or Agent6, they would want Agent1 dead. This aligns with Agent1's death. However, if Agent0 or Agent6 were the werewolf, they would want to eliminate the other person who voted for them. Agent0 voted for Agent1, Agent6 voted for Agent1. Agent0 and Agent6 did not vote for each other.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the werewolf is one of the people who did *not* vote for Agent1 on Day 2. This leaves Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2. Agent3 is asking questions, which is village-like. Agent5 and Agent2 are the most suspicious due to their consistent silence and playing it safe. Between Agent5 and Agent2, Agent5's statement about \"listening very carefully\" is very generic. Agent2's \"playing it safe\" and \"keeping an eye on everyone's behavior\" is also generic.\n\nI will vote for Agent2.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Now that Agent1 is gone, the focus shifts. Agent3, Agent5, and Agent2 all abstained from voting for Agent1. Agent0 and Agent6 were the ones who voted for Agent1.\n\nIf Agent0 or Agent6 are the werewolves, they would want to eliminate the other person who was actively accusing them, which was Agent1. Since Agent1 is dead, they might try to pick off another active player to sow discord. Or, they might want to eliminate one of the quiet players to get rid of potential villagers.\n\nHowever, the fact that Agent0 and Agent6 were the only ones to vote for Agent1 on Day 2 is notable. Agent0 is now suggesting we look at the \"quiet players.\" Agent5 and Agent2 have been consistently quiet, always voting NOONE. This caution could be seen as trying to hide, or it could be genuine caution from villagers.\n\nAgent0's reasoning for voting for Agent1 was that Agent1's initial accusation against Agent0 was a red flag. Agent6 agreed. This makes sense from a villager perspective. Now Agent0 is pointing to the quiet players.\n\nI'm going to follow the logic that the consistently quiet players are the most suspicious. Between Agent2 and Agent5, Agent2's reasoning for abstaining yesterday was \"playing it safe and keeping an eye on everyone's behavior,\" which is a very standard, non-committal statement.

We are now down to Agent6, Agent3, Agent5, and Agent0.\n\nLet's recap the votes and suspicions:\nDay 1: Agent1 voted Agent0. Everyone else (Agent3, Agent0, Agent6, Agent2, Agent5) voted NOONE.\nDay 2: Agent0 voted Agent1. Agent6 voted Agent1. Agent3, Agent5, Agent2, Agent1 voted NOONE.\nDay 3: Agent0 voted Agent3. Agent6 voted Agent2. Agent3 voted NOONE. Agent5 voted Agent0. Agent2 voted NOONE.\nDay 4 (last night): Agent2 was killed.\n\nOn Day 3, Agent0 accused Agent3. Agent6 accused Agent2. Agent5 accused Agent0. Agent3 and Agent2 voted NOONE. This was a very split day. Agent0, Agent6, and Agent5 all made accusations, with Agent0 and Agent6 accusing different people, and Agent5 accusing Agent0.\n\nThen Agent2 was killed last night. Agent2 was accused by Agent6 on Day 3. Agent2 also voted NOONE on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3. Agent2's persistent NOONE votes suggest extreme caution, or being the werewolf.\n\nLet's look at the current survivors and their actions:\nAgent0: Voted NOONE (Day 1), voted Agent1 (Day 2), voted Agent3 (Day 3). Agent0 has been accusing people.\nAgent3: Voted NOONE (Day 1), voted NOONE (Day 2), voted NOONE (Day 3). Agent3 has been consistently cautious.\nAgent5: Voted NOONE (Day 1), voted NOONE (Day 2), voted Agent0 (Day 3). Agent5 made an accusation on Day 3.\nAgent6: Voted NOONE (Day 1), voted Agent1 (Day 2), voted Agent2 (Day 3). Agent6 has been consistently accusing people.\n\nAgent2 was killed last night. Agent6 accused Agent2 on Day 3. Agent0 accused Agent3 on Day 3. Agent5 accused Agent0 on Day 3.\n\nIf Agent6 is the werewolf, their accusation of Agent2 on Day 3 would be to deflect. And then they would kill Agent2 last night to silence them. This is a strong possibility.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, their accusation of Agent3 on Day 3 would be to deflect. Their earlier vote for Agent1 was also suspicious. They are actively accusing others.\n\nIf Agent5 is the werewolf, their accusation of Agent0 on Day 3 would be to deflect.\n\nIf Agent3 is the werewolf, their consistent NOONE votes would be to hide.\n\nLet's think about who would want Agent2 dead. Agent6 accused Agent2. If Agent2 was a villager, then Agent6 might be the werewolf. If Agent2 was the werewolf, then Agent6 might be a villager who correctly identified them.\n\nHowever, considering the pattern of accusations, Agent6 has been the most consistently active in trying to identify someone, similar to how Agent1 was initially. Agent0 has also been active. Agent5 made an accusation yesterday. Agent3 has been silent.\n\nAgent2's death, after being accused by Agent6, makes Agent6 a prime suspect. If Agent2 was the werewolf, then Agent6 correctly identified them and then the werewolf killed Agent2. If Agent2 was a villager, then Agent6 is the werewolf who killed them.\n\nAgent5 accusing Agent0 yesterday also puts Agent5 under suspicion, and if Agent0 is the werewolf, Agent5 might be a villager trying to expose them.\n\nAgent0 accusing Agent3 is also something to consider. If Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent3 might be a villager they are trying to frame. If Agent0 is a villager, then Agent3 might be the werewolf.\n\nThis is very messy. Agent6 accusing Agent2 and then Agent2 dying is a major clue. Agent6 has been consistently voting and making accusations. This is either a strong villager trying to uncover the truth, or a cunning werewolf.\n\nI'm going to focus on Agent6. They accused Agent2, who was then killed. This is a classic werewolf move \u2013 accuse someone and then eliminate them.\n\nVOTE: Agent6",

Agent6 voted for Agent2. The remaining players (Agent2, Agent3, Agent5, Agent0) all voted NOONE. No, that's not right. On Day 3, Agent0 voted for me, Agent6 voted for Agent2, and then Agent2, Agent3, and Agent5 all voted NOONE.\n\nThis means on Day 3, the votes were:\nAgent0 -> Agent3\nAgent6 -> Agent2\nAgent2 -> NOONE\nAgent3 -> NOONE (me)\nAgent5 -> NOONE\n\nAgent2 was killed last night. This means Agent0 and Agent6 were the only ones to vote for someone who was not eliminated. Agent0 voted for me (Agent3), and Agent6 voted for Agent2. Agent2 was killed.\n\nThis implies that either Agent0 or Agent6 is the werewolf, and they managed to get Agent2 killed. Agent0 voted for me on Day 3, and Agent2 was killed. Agent6 voted for Agent2 on Day 3, and Agent2 was killed. This is a strong indication that Agent6 might be the werewolf, as their vote directly led to the elimination of Agent2, who was then killed. It could also be Agent0, as their vote for me didn't result in my death, but perhaps they were trying to divert attention.\n\nLet's consider Agent0's actions. On Day 1, Agent1 voted for Agent0. Agent0 responded by saying Agent1 was deflecting. On Day 2, Agent0 voted for Agent1. On Day 3, Agent0 voted for Agent3 (me). Agent0 has been consistently trying to identify someone.\n\nNow consider Agent6. On Day 1, Agent6 voted NOONE. On Day 2, Agent6 voted for Agent1. On Day 3, Agent6 voted for Agent2. Agent6's vote for Agent2 on Day 3, followed by Agent2's death, makes Agent6 extremely suspicious. Agent6 also voted for Agent1 on Day 2.\n\nAgent3 (myself) and Agent5 have been voting NOONE for most of this game. This is still suspicious, but Agent5's vote on Day 2 was NOONE, and Agent3's vote on Day 2 was NOONE. On Day 3, both Agent3 (myself) and Agent5 voted NOONE.\n\nThe person who made the vote that *resulted* in the killed person being eliminated is the most suspicious.
