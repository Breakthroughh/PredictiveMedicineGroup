Agent3, you wanted to eliminate Agent0, and Agent0 wanted to eliminate you. Now Agent0 is dead.

      "content": "Agent0 is dead. That means our earlier vote for Agent0 was incorrect. Agent2 and Agent4 both voted NOONE yesterday, which is interesting. It means they likely didn't suspect anyone strongly enough to risk a vote. Agent0 was actively trying to frame me by voting for me, which is a classic werewolf move to try and look like a villager. Now it's just us three. Agent2 and Agent4 are the only ones who haven't been eliminated. Agent2 voted NOONE, so they are still a possibility. Agent4 also voted NOONE.\n\nGiven that Agent0 voted for me last round, and now Agent0 is dead, it's highly probable that the other werewolf is either Agent2 or Agent4. Since Agent0 is gone, and Agent2 and Agent4 abstained from voting, they might be playing it safe. If Agent2 or Agent4 was the werewolf, they might be trying to make me look suspicious by not voting for anyone, leaving me as the only one who voted for Agent0. It's a tough call.\n\nHowever, Agent2's initial statement was quite cautious, and Agent4's also didn't seem to give away much. If one of them were the werewolf, they might have tried to push a vote onto me. Since they didn't, and Agent0 did, it makes Agent0 a prime suspect for being the werewolf, which is now confirmed.\n\nNow, with Agent0 gone, we are down to three. If there was only one werewolf, then the game is over and the villagers win. But assuming there are two werewolves, then one of the remaining two (Agent2 or Agent4) is the other werewolf. Agent2 and Agent4 both voted NOONE in the last round. This could be them playing it safe, or it could be them trying to let the werewolf kill again without revealing themselves.\n\nConsidering the most recent events, and how Agent0 tried to pin the blame on me, it seems more likely that the other werewolf is among the remaining two. Agent2 was very reserved. Agent4 was also reserved. If one of them is the werewolf, they would want to eliminate me. Since they both voted NOONE last round, they might be trying to get me to make the first move this round.\n\nLet's think about who is most suspicious. Agent2 expressed concern, but didn't offer a concrete target. Agent4 also expressed concern. Both are plausible villagers. Agent2's questioning of me seemed a bit pointed, but also could be interpreted as a genuine villager trying to gather information.\n\nGiven that Agent0 is dead, and they were targeting me, it's likely the other werewolf is either Agent2 or Agent4. Neither of them pushed a vote against anyone last round, which is strange for villagers. If one of them is the werewolf, they might be letting me take the heat.\n\nSince we are now at three, and the werewolf was responsible for killing Agent1 and Agent0, it's possible there's another werewolf here. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they might be trying to make me look bad by having me vote. If Agent4 is the werewolf, same logic.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial votes. I voted for Agent0. Agent0 voted for Agent3. Agent2 and Agent4 voted NOONE. Then Agent0 was killed. This implies that the majority voted for Agent0, or there was a tie and Agent0 was randomly selected.\n\nNow it's just us three. If there's one werewolf left, it's either Agent2 or Agent4. If there are two werewolves, then both Agent2 and Agent4 could be werewolves. But that's usually not how the game works with only 5 players to start. Typically, it's one or two werewolves. With 5 players and 2 werewolves, it's a very tough game. With 5 players and 1 werewolf, that's more standard.\n\nIf there's only one werewolf left, and that werewolf is either Agent2 or Agent4, they would want to eliminate me, the villager. If Agent2 is the werewolf, they'd want me gone. If Agent4 is the werewolf, they'd want me gone. So, it's likely one of them is the werewolf.\n\nAgent2's questioning of me felt a little like they were trying to get me to reveal myself. Agent4's comments were more general. I think Agent2 is a slightly better target to eliminate because of the direct questions.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",
