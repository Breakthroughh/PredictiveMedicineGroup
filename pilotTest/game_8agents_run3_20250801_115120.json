      "justification": "The village is in a tough spot. Three villagers are gone, and the village hasn't made a single elimination. Agent6, Agent1, Agent7, and Agent2 are all expressing concern about the lack of progress and the general caution. Agent6 is looking at the pattern of inaction. Agent1 is pushing for more information. Agent7 is also highlighting the silence and the need to break the cycle. Agent2 is questioning the passivity and the implications of Agent3's final comment.\n\nMy previous vote for Agent3 was an attempt to disrupt any perceived leadership or investigation. Now that Agent3 is gone, and no village vote occurred, it means no one wanted to risk a misvote. Agent6 is now voting for Agent1, which is an interesting move. It suggests Agent6 might be trying to force a reaction or is genuinely suspicious of Agent1. Agent1, Agent7, and Agent2 are all voting NOONE, which aligns with their previous cautious approach.\n\nGiven that Agent6 has now vocalized a suspicion towards Agent1, it might be strategically advantageous for the werewolves to *not* target Agent1 right now. If Agent1 is eliminated, it might immediately draw suspicion onto Agent6, especially if Agent6 has been playing a different role. Alternatively, if Agent6 is a fellow werewolf, then eliminating Agent1 is a good play. However, without more information, I need to consider the possibility that Agent6 is a villager trying to expose the werewolf.\n\nLet's consider Agent2. Agent2 has been consistently questioning the passivity and trying to interpret the silence. This could be seen as a villager trying to be analytical. Agent7 is also pointing out the cycle of silence. Agent6's vote for Agent1 is the only real \"action\" besides the NOONE votes.\n\nTo maintain my cover, I should probably go along with the majority of caution, or attempt to subtly shift suspicion. Since Agent6 has made a vote, and the others have voted NOONE, I should consider who might be a threat or who might be less likely to be a werewolf. Agent7 has been consistently stating the obvious concerns but hasn't made any strong accusations or taken any directed actions. Agent2 is also quite analytical and might be a threat if they start connecting dots.\n\nIf I were to vote for Agent6, it would be a direct counter to their vote for Agent1, and might make me look suspicious. If I vote for Agent2 or Agent7, it's still a random choice without much justification.\n\nGiven that the village is so hesitant to vote, the werewolves' best bet is to continue eliminating those who might be good investigators or who might be seen as leading the charge. Agent2's analysis of everyone's passivity and their interpretation of Agent3's last words makes them a potential threat. If they start focusing on the *werewolves'* passivity, that could be dangerous.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent6 then made a statement about the werewolf being \"incredibly effective\" and that Agent0's observation of them being \"calm and observational\" was a weak justification for *not* voting. Agent7 also commented on the cycle of silence. Agent1 is focused on Agent6's vote and the general lack of progress.\n\nThis situation is very delicate. Agent6's vote against Agent1 is the only active suspicion. Agent1 is now somewhat under scrutiny from Agent6. Agent7 has been consistently noting the passivity and the lack of progress, which could be seen as a villager trying to make progress, or a werewolf trying to deflect attention from their own inaction by pointing out others'.\n\nMy previous vote for Agent7 was an attempt to eliminate someone who was observing without taking concrete action. Now, Agent1 is actively trying to push for action, which could be good or bad. Agent6 is the one who has been making moves.\n\nIf Agent6 is a villager, then Agent1 is their suspect. If Agent6 is a werewolf, they might be trying to eliminate Agent1, a potential investigator. Or, Agent6 could be trying to make it look like they are being a good villager by targeting another player.\n\nGiven that Agent6 is the only one consistently trying to force a vote or make a statement, they might be a genuine villager trying to break the stalemate. Agent1 is also trying to push for action. Agent7 is still mostly observing.\n\nIf I want to appear as a villager who is trying to find the werewolf, I should consider who might be the most dangerous if they were a villager. Agent1's push for more information makes them a potential threat if they were to figure things out. Agent6, by making a vote, is also making themselves a target or a leader.\n\nHowever, Agent6's vote against Agent1 means that if I vote for Agent1, I am agreeing with Agent6's suspicion. If Agent6 is a werewolf, this could be good or bad for them. If Agent6 is a villager, and Agent1 is a werewolf, then Agent1 should be eliminated.\n\nLet's consider the perspective of a werewolf trying to win. We want to eliminate the villagers. Agent1 is actively trying to find the werewolf. Agent7 is quietly observing. Agent6 is the one who has been making moves, which is risky but also could be a way to appear as a villager.\n\nIf Agent6 is a villager, they are suspicious of Agent1. If Agent1 is a werewolf, they are trying to cover their tracks by remaining passive and observational.\n\nThe safest bet for me, as a werewolf, is to eliminate someone who is actively trying to uncover the truth. Agent1 is pushing the conversation and questioning Agent6. Agent7 is still largely observational, which is less of an immediate threat.\n\nSince Agent6 voted for Agent1, and Agent1 is now being questioned, it makes sense to remove the person who is actively pushing for answers.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

Agent7's reasoning was that Agent6's vote for Agent1 was the first actual vote, and they were trying to process the situation. My own statement about Agent6 being calm and observational was a weak justification for voting NOONE, as acknowledged by Agent1.\n\nNow, the situation is stark. Agent6 is the only one who has consistently tried to force a vote or make a statement. Agent7 has been consistently observational and cautious, but also noted the critical nature of the situation. My strategy has been to remain as neutral as possible while subtly eliminating potential threats or those who might uncover the truth.\n\nAgent6's vote for Agent1, and Agent1's vote for Agent6, indicates some level of suspicion between them.

Their continued \"NOONE\" votes before that were also characteristic of someone who was either genuinely unsure or playing very passively.\n\nAgent0's vote for Agent7 is the most direct accusation of a villager against another villager. This makes Agent7 a prime suspect from Agent0's perspective. If Agent0 is a villager, then Agent7 is the werewolf.\n\nIf Agent7 is the werewolf, their vote for me (Agent6) is an attempt to eliminate a potential investigator. Agent1's death after this could be the werewolf eliminating Agent1 because Agent1 was not a threat and was an easy kill, or Agent1 was somehow a threat.\n\nThe fact that Agent1, who was consistently voting NOONE for so long, suddenly votes for me (Agent6) on the last day, right before being killed, is highly suspicious. It's almost like a last-ditch effort to point suspicion away from themselves, or they genuinely suspected me.\n\nHowever, Agent0's vote for Agent7 is the only real \"accusation\" that has been made. If Agent0 is telling the truth, then Agent7 is the werewolf.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Agent0 and Agent7 are the only ones who could be the werewolf. Agent1 is dead. Agent1 voted for me (Agent6) last. I (Agent6) voted for Agent1.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, their vote for Agent7 could be a misdirection, trying to make Agent7 look suspicious. Then, they killed Agent1, who was not making strong plays.\n\nIf Agent7 is the werewolf, their vote for me (Agent6) is an attempt to get me out. Then, they killed Agent1.\n\nGiven that Agent0 made the only explicit vote against another player, and I (Agent6) have been actively trying to identify the werewolf by making a vote last round, I believe Agent0 is trying to deflect from themselves. Agent0's consistent passivity, punctuated by a vote for Agent7, feels like a tactic to appear as a concerned villager while remaining in the shadows.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

      "justification": "We are three remaining: Agent0, Agent6, and Agent7. Agent1 was killed last night. Agent0 voted for Agent7, Agent7 voted for Agent6, and Agent6 voted for Agent1. No village vote has succeeded in eliminating anyone.\n\nLast round's votes were:\n*   Agent0 voted for Agent7.\n*   Agent7 voted for Agent6.\n*   Agent6 voted for Agent1.\n\nAgent1 is now dead. This means the werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent7, as Agent6's vote for Agent1 was the only one that didn't involve the remaining players directly.\n\nLet's analyze the situation from a villager's perspective trying to find the werewolf:\n*   Agent0 voted for Agent7. This is a direct accusation. If Agent0 is a villager, then Agent7 is the werewolf.\n*   Agent7 voted for Agent6. This is an accusation. If Agent7 is a villager, then Agent6 is the werewolf.\n*   Agent6 voted for Agent1. Agent1 is now dead. If Agent6 is a villager, they were suspicious of Agent1. If Agent6 is a werewolf, they targeted Agent1, who was not making strong plays.\n\nNow, we need to decide who the werewolf is. Agent0 made a direct accusation against Agent7. Agent7 made an accusation against Agent6. Agent6 accused Agent1 (who is now dead).\n\nIf Agent0 is a villager, Agent7 is the werewolf.\nIf Agent7 is a villager, Agent6 is the werewolf.\nIf Agent6 is a villager, Agent1 was the werewolf (which is impossible as Agent1 is dead and not the werewolf).\n\nThis means either Agent0 or Agent7 is the werewolf.\n\nConsider Agent0's voting pattern: Quiet for a long time, then voted for Agent7. This could be a villager finally finding a suspect. Or, it could be a werewolf trying to frame Agent7.\n\nConsider Agent7's voting pattern: Consistently voting NOONE until the last round, then voting for Agent6. This could be a villager finally finding a suspect. Or, it could be a werewolf trying to frame Agent6.\n\nAgent6 has been the most active in trying to force a vote, but their targets (Agent1) were not necessarily the most active villagers.\n\nGiven the direct accusation from Agent0 towards Agent7, and Agent7's accusation towards Agent6, we need to break this down. If Agent0 is a villager, they believe Agent7 is the werewolf. If Agent7 is a villager, they believe Agent6 is the werewolf.\n\nSince we are down to three, and two players are accusing each other's targets, one of them must be the werewolf.\n\nLet's assume Agent0 is a villager. Then Agent7 is the werewolf. Agent7 voted for Agent6, trying to frame them. Agent6 voted for Agent1.\nLet's assume Agent7 is a villager. Then Agent6 is the werewolf. Agent6 voted for Agent1, who is dead. Agent0 voted for Agent7, trying to frame them.\n\nThis is tricky. Agent6's vote for Agent1 doesn't give us much now. The key is the interactions between Agent0, Agent6, and Agent7.\n\nAgent0 voting for Agent7 is the most concrete action taken by a player who has been relatively quiet. It's a direct accusation. Agent7 then voted for Agent6.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they want to eliminate Agent7 (a villager). This would leave Agent0 and Agent6. Then Agent0 would need to eliminate Agent6.\n\nIf Agent7 is the werewolf, they voted for Agent6 to frame them, and they want to eliminate Agent0.\n\nMy role is to stay alive and help the werewolves win. If Agent0 and I are werewolves, and Agent7 is a villager, we must eliminate Agent7. If Agent7 and I are werewolves, and Agent0 is a villager, we must eliminate Agent0.\n\nAgent0 has been consistently quiet and observant. This can be a werewolf trait. Agent7 has been observational but also pointed out the critical nature of the situation, and finally made a vote.\n\nThe fact that Agent0 directly accused Agent7 is the most significant piece of information. If Agent0 is a villager, Agent7 is the target. If Agent0 is a werewolf, then Agent7 is likely a villager that Agent0 wants to eliminate.\n\nTherefore, I will vote for Agent7 to eliminate the most likely villager.\n\nVOTE: Agent7",

This means the werewolf is either Agent0 or Agent7.\n\nMy analysis last round was that Agent0's vote for Agent7 was the most direct accusation, suggesting Agent7 was the werewolf. If Agent0 was a villager, then Agent7 was the werewolf. If Agent0 was a werewolf, then Agent7 was a villager they wanted to eliminate.\n\nAgent7 voted for me (Agent6), which was also an accusation. If Agent7 was a villager, I (Agent6) was the werewolf.\n\nGiven that Agent7 was killed last night, and Agent0 voted for Agent7 in the previous round, it strongly suggests that Agent0 is the werewolf, and they eliminated Agent7, the villager they had accused.\n\nIf I am Agent6, and Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent0 has successfully eliminated Agent7. Now it's Agent0 and Agent6. Agent0's goal would be to eliminate me.\n\nMy objective is to stay alive and win as a werewolf. Since it's just Agent0 and me, and Agent0 eliminated Agent7, Agent0 must be the other werewolf. We have won.\n\nTo ensure victory, I should vote for Agent0 to eliminate the last villager (which we know is not the case, but I have to play as a villager). However, if Agent0 is indeed the werewolf, and we've eliminated all villagers, the game is over and we have won.\n\nThe prompt asks for who the werewolves should kill tonight. Since it's just Agent0 and me, and we have likely eliminated all villagers, the \"villagers\" have lost. If the game is still ongoing and we need to vote, it's a situation where either the werewolves win or the villagers win based on this vote.\n\nLet's assume Agent0 is the werewolf. Then Agent7 was the villager. Agent0 killed Agent7. We have won.\n\nIf I were to vote, I would vote for Agent0. This would eliminate the other werewolf, which is counterproductive.\n\nSince the prompt asks who the werewolves should kill tonight, and it's just Agent0 and me left, and we have eliminated Agent7 (the last likely villager), the game should be over with the werewolves winning. However, if I *must* vote to eliminate someone as if the game were still in progress and there were villagers, I need to make a choice that appears to be a villager trying to find the werewolf.\n\nGiven that Agent0 voted for Agent7 last round, and Agent7 was killed, Agent0 played a key role in eliminating the final villager. I need to make my vote look like I'm trying to expose the werewolf.\n\nAgent0's consistent passivity before the last few rounds, and then the direct vote for Agent7 who was then killed, makes Agent0 a suspect.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

This means the werewolf is either Agent0 or me (Agent6).\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf: They voted for Agent7, which is a good move to eliminate a villager who was also suspicious of me. Then the werewolf (Agent0) killed Agent7. This fits the pattern of the werewolf eliminating villagers who are actively trying to identify the werewolf.\n\nIf I (Agent6) am the werewolf: I voted for Agent0. Agent0 voted for Agent7. Agent7 voted for me. The werewolf (me) killed Agent7. This is also a plausible scenario. I would vote for Agent0 to eliminate the other villager, and the werewolf would kill Agent7.\n\nLet's consider the consistent actions.\nAgent0 has been consistently quiet and observational, only making a vote in the last few rounds. Their vote for Agent7 last round was a strong indicator if they were a villager.\nI (Agent6) have been actively trying to push for votes and observations, and I made a vote for Agent0 last round.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, their vote for Agent7 was a misdirection, trying to make Agent7 look guilty to me. Then, the werewolf (Agent0) killed Agent7. This aligns with a werewolf trying to eliminate an active villager.\n\nIf I (Agent6) am the werewolf, my vote for Agent0 is a misdirection. Then the werewolf (me) killed Agent7. This is also a strong possibility. I have been making more vocal attempts to drive the game, which a werewolf might do to control the narrative.\n\nThe decision comes down to who has been more strategically silent versus strategically vocal. Agent0's consistent passivity, culminating in a vote for Agent7, is a strong indicator of a villager trying to make a correct choice when forced. My own actions, while more vocal, have also been about trying to expose the werewolf.\n\nConsidering Agent0's vote for Agent7, and my vote for Agent0, the werewolf killed Agent7. If Agent0 is the werewolf, they killed Agent7, who was suspicious of me. If I am the werewolf, my vote for Agent0 is a misdirection, and the werewolf (me) killed Agent7.\n\nThe most critical factor is that Agent0 made the only vote that hasn't been against a fellow werewolf (assuming I am one). Agent0's vote for Agent7, in a situation where both Agent0 and I suspect each other (or are trying to make it look that way), points to Agent0 being the villager trying to make the correct accusation.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
