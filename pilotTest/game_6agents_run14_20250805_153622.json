Agent0, you voted for Agent2 yesterday. Agent2 voted for Agent0. I voted for Agent3. Agent0, you said Agent1 suspected you yesterday, and then you also noted that Agent2 wanted to vote NOONE. Agent2, you voted for Agent0 yesterday, and you seem to be focusing on my early votes for Agent0. Your reasoning for voting Agent0 yesterday was that they were \"too keen to point fingers\" and it could be \"misdirection.\" However, you yourself have now voted for Agent0. Agent0, you voted for Agent3 yesterday.\n\nLet's look at the votes again:\nDay 1: Agent1 voted Agent0. Agent0 voted Agent3. Agent2 voted NOONE. Agent3 voted NOONE. (No elimination)\nDay 2: Agent0 voted Agent3. Agent1 voted Agent3. Agent2 voted Agent0. Agent3 voted Agent0. (Agent3 killed)\nDay 3: Agent1 voted Agent3. Agent0 voted Agent2. Agent2 voted Agent0. Agent3 voted Agent0. (Agent3 killed) Wait, Agent3 was killed on Night 3. That means Day 3's voting is still pending.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the votes from Day 2.\nAgent0 voted for Agent3.\nAgent1 voted for Agent3.\nAgent2 voted for Agent0.\nAgent3 voted for Agent0.\nThis meant Agent0 got 2 votes, Agent3 got 2 votes. No majority. Agent5 was killed by the werewolf on Night 2.\n\nNow we are at the start of Day 3.\nAlive: Agent1, Agent0, Agent2.\nNight 1: Agent4 killed.\nNight 2: Agent5 killed.\nNight 3: Agent3 killed.\n\nThis is a pure deduction game now. Agent0, you said Agent5 was vocal about finding the werewolf, and then voted for Agent3. Agent2, you voted for Agent0, saying they were too keen to point fingers, then you voted for Agent0 again. That's quite consistent. Agent5 was killed after Agent0 voted for Agent3. Then Agent3 was killed after Agent0 voted for Agent3 again. This pattern of Agent0 voting for Agent3 is what Agent0 claims is them targeting a \"promising investigator\" (Agent4).\n\nAgent2, you've been critical of people's votes. You thought my vote for Agent0 on Day 1 was interesting, then you thought Agent0 was too keen to point fingers and voted for them on Day 2. Now, on Day 3, you are voting for Agent0 again. Your reasoning that Agent0 might be misdirecting by voting for Agent3 could be valid, but Agent0's consistent voting against Agent3 who was seemingly trying to be neutral might just be them eliminating potential threats.\n\nAgent0, you voted for Agent3 on Day 2, and you voted for Agent3 on Day 1 as well. Agent3 voted for NOONE twice. Agent5 voted for Agent0 on Day 1. Agent2 voted NOONE on Day 1, Agent0 on Day 2.\n\nThe fact that Agent3 was killed on Night 3, after Agent0 and I both voted for them on Day 2, is very suspicious. Agent3 was also voting for Agent0 on Day 2. This means Agent0 was also a target for Agent3.\n\nAgent2's reasoning about Agent0's \"keenness to point fingers\" and \"misdirection\" seems plausible. If Agent0 is the werewolf, they would want to eliminate active villagers. Agent4 and Agent5 were both active in trying to find the werewolf. Agent3 was quieter but was killed after being targeted by multiple people, including Agent0.\n\nConsider this: If Agent0 is the werewolf, voting for Agent3 makes sense to eliminate a potential villager who might have been investigating. Agent0 also voted for Agent3 on Day 2. Agent2 voted for Agent0 on Day 2 and Day 3.\n\nI'm going to consider Agent2's consistent targeting of Agent0. They've provided a rationale for it. My initial vote for Agent0 was based on their strong declaration about Agent4 being an investigator without providing evidence.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
