Agent5 asked about anything unusual, which is a good question, but no one has responded to it yet. I think we need to try and pressure someone into revealing something, or make a move that might cause a reaction. Agent0 and Agent4 also stated they were listening, which is a safe play, but doesn't give us much to work with.\n\nI'll target Agent5. They asked a question last night, which is more engagement than some others, but their mention of \"keeping an open mind about everyone\" is a bit too neutral for my liking in these early stages. Perhaps they are trying to appear non-committal, or they genuinely have no idea.

Agent3 and Agent4 have been trying to prompt discussion. Agent1 has been more observational. I haven't really revealed much myself, trying to be a good observer.\n\nGiven that we've lost three people without any eliminations, it suggests either the werewolves are very good at blending in or we're too hesitant. Agent3 and Agent4's attempts to get people talking might have made them targets, or they might have been trying to force a werewolf's hand. Agent1's passive approach could be genuine caution or a calculated move to avoid suspicion.\n\nI'm leaning towards Agent1. Their consistent statement about \"lying low\" and \"observing\" could be a double bluff. They haven't pushed any theories and have stayed very neutral.

The werewolves are clearly in control of the night.\n\nLooking back, Agent0 was focused on Agent6's comment about Agent2 being a \"good player.\" Agent4 was frustrated by the lack of leads and asking for suspicions. Agent1 felt the werewolf was playing cautiously. I voted for Agent6, trying to disrupt a potential villager investigation based on Agent0's observation.\n\nNow, with only four of us left, the pressure is immense. It's highly likely there's only one werewolf remaining among us, or perhaps a pair if one was also eliminated. The fact that no one was eliminated during the day implies that the werewolves are confident in their night-time kills and don't need to force a day vote.\n\nAgent0's focus on Agent6's earlier statement is the most concrete observation we have. Agent1's assessment of cautious play could apply to anyone, but it's a reasonable assumption. Agent4's frustration is understandable but doesn't point fingers.\n\nI need to consider who is most likely to be suspected or who might be trying to lead the group towards a villager. Agent0's detailed observation of Agent6 could be a villager trying to highlight a subtle clue. If I were to vote for Agent0, it might appear as if I'm trying to silence someone who is getting close to the truth. Agent1's continued \"cautious play\" might be a tactic to avoid scrutiny.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was the one who pointed out Agent6's comment, and Agent6 was killed last night (which I supported), it might be beneficial to target Agent0. This plays into the idea that Agent0 was trying to sniff out the werewolf. If Agent0 is a villager, we lose a potential ally. If Agent0 is a werewolf, we eliminate a threat.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Last night, my vote was for Agent0, suspecting their focus on Agent6 might be a villager's attempt to uncover something, or a werewolf's attempt to deflect. However, no one was eliminated, meaning the votes were split.\n\nAgent1 and Agent4 both voted \"NOONE\", which is understandable given the uncertainty. Agent0, as discussed, voted for me. This means my vote for Agent0 was countered by their vote for me.\n\nNow, with only four of us left, there's a very high chance there's only one werewolf remaining, or perhaps two if they're working together and haven't been caught yet. The fact that a kill didn't happen last night is concerning. It implies either hesitation or a lack of a clear majority.\n\nWe need to try and break this deadlock. Agent1's continued cautiousness is still a factor. Agent4's frustration is also a constant. Agent0's earlier observation about Agent6 is the only semi-specific piece of analysis we've had.\n\nSince the votes were split between Agent0 and me, and Agent1 and Agent4 abstained from voting, it's hard to say who the werewolves might be targeting. However, if there are two werewolves remaining, they would likely want to eliminate a strong villager. If there's only one, they'll target someone who seems like a threat or someone who is close to discovering them.\n\nAgent1's consistent neutrality and observation might be a good play for a werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. They haven't made any strong accusations or defenses. This could be interpreted as strategic positioning.\n\nVOTE: Agent1",

This is the final stretch.\n\nYesterday was incredibly frustrating because no one was eliminated, despite the pressure to vote. Agent0 voted for me, Agent3. I voted for Agent0. Agent1 voted \"NOONE.\"\n\nAgent0's reasoning for voting for me was that my consistent \"cautious play\" could be a double bluff and that I hadn't pushed any theories. Agent3's reasoning for voting for Agent0 was that Agent0 was focusing on Agent6's comment about Agent2 being a \"good player,\" and that if Agent0 was a villager trying to find the truth, targeting them would be a mistake.\n\nNow Agent1 is dead. Agent0, Agent3, Agent4. One of us is the werewolf. Agent0 thought I was the werewolf yesterday. Agent3 thought Agent0 was the werewolf yesterday. I thought Agent0 was the werewolf yesterday.\n\nThis is a difficult situation. Agent0, your reasoning for voting for me was interesting. You felt my caution was a tactic. Agent3, you voted for Agent0, believing they were getting close.\n\nLet's think about who has been the most quiet, or the most active in a way that might be misleading. Agent1's death is a blow. If Agent1 was a werewolf, then it's down to Agent0 and me. If Agent1 was a villager, then either Agent0 or Agent3 is the werewolf.\n\nI'm still leaning towards Agent0. Their analysis of Agent6 calling Agent2 a \"good player\" and then Agent6's death, followed by Agent0's vote against me, feels like a strategic game. Agent0 also pointed out that Agent1 was still feeling out the situation.\n\nLet's consider who benefits from Agent1's death. If Agent1 was a villager, then the werewolf is still among us. If Agent1 was a werewolf, then Agent0 or Agent3 must be the other werewolf, or they are both villagers.\n\nGiven that Agent0 was the one who initially brought up Agent6's comment about Agent2, and then Agent0 voted for me (Agent4), who also voted for Agent0, it feels like a diversion. Agent0 is also very analytical and pointing out everyone's statements.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

The werewolves are still at large.\n\nYesterday, it was a stalemate. Agent1 and Agent4 both voted NOONE. Agent0 and Agent3 both voted for each other (Agent0 voted Agent1, Agent3 voted Agent0). Agent0's reasoning for voting for Agent1 was that Agent1's \"observational\" and \"cautious\" play could be a double bluff, and that Agent1 hadn't pushed theories. Agent3's reasoning for voting for Agent0 was that Agent0 was the one who pointed out Agent6's earlier comment, and Agent6's death might mean Agent0 was getting close.\n\nNow Agent1 is dead. This means either Agent0 or Agent3 is the werewolf, or the werewolf is outside of our voting group, which is impossible since it's just us three. Agent1's death definitely shakes things up. If Agent0 was the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 to eliminate someone who was suspicious of them. If Agent3 was the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 because Agent1's vote for Agent0 was a potential misdirection, or because Agent1 was an active player who could be a threat.\n\nThe fact that the vote was split between Agent0 and Agent3 yesterday, and then Agent1 was killed, makes me suspicious of both. However, Agent0 was the one who specifically targeted me (Agent3) in their reasoning. Agent0 said my observation about Agent6 was \"a good strategy\" but then voted for me. That's a contradiction. And Agent3's vote for Agent0 was based on Agent0 potentially getting close to the truth.\n\nConsidering the recent events:\n*   Agent0 suspected me (Agent3) and voted for me.\n*   Agent3 suspected Agent0 and voted for me.\n*   Agent1 was killed last night.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 because Agent1 voted for Agent0 (even if it was a false accusation or a real one), or simply to thin our numbers. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they might have killed Agent1 because Agent1's vote for Agent0 could have been a distraction, or because Agent1 was a threat.\n\nMy previous reasoning for voting for Agent0 was that their observation about Agent6 was the most concrete thing we had, and if they were a werewolf, they might have killed Agent6 to silence that observation. But then Agent0 voted for me.\n\nThis is very difficult. Agent0's logic for voting for me felt a bit convoluted. Agent3's logic for voting for Agent0 was more direct, albeit still speculative.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they voted for me (Agent3) and Agent1 was killed. This means Agent0 might have worked with another werewolf to kill Agent1, or Agent1 was killed for another reason. But we're down to three. So it has to be one of us.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Agent0 said: \"I'm still trying to get a feel for who's trying to lead the conversation versus who's just observing.\" Then Agent0 voted for me. And Agent0's earlier reasoning was \"I'm leaning towards Agent1. Their consistent statement about 'lying low' and 'observing' could be a double bluff.\" But then Agent1 died. This implies Agent0's suspicion of Agent1 was correct, and the werewolf killed Agent1 to silence them. If Agent0 was truly suspecting Agent1, and Agent1 was killed, then Agent0 should be relieved. But Agent0 also voted for me. This is confusing.\n\nMy previous vote for Agent0 was based on their observation about Agent6 and then voting for me. This is still a strong suspicion.\n\nLet's consider Agent4. Agent4 has been mostly asking questions and expressing frustration about the lack of leads. They haven't made any accusations or strong arguments. This passive approach could be genuine caution, or it could be the werewolf's strategy to stay out of the spotlight and let others take the blame.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, they might be trying to frame me by voting for me and then having Agent1 killed. If Agent3 is the werewolf, they might be trying to frame Agent0 or Agent1.\n\nGiven that Agent1 died after Agent0 voted for me and Agent3 voted for Agent0, it's really hard to say. Agent1's death is the key. If Agent1 was a werewolf, they would have been killed by the other werewolf. If Agent1 was a villager, they were killed by the werewolf.\n\nI think Agent4 has been the most consistently quiet and least committal. Agent0 has been making observations and voting. Agent3 (myself) has been trying to piece things together, but my reasoning for voting for Agent0 was flawed, as Agent1 was killed.\n\nAgent4's silence is becoming more suspicious. They haven't offered any theories, just stated frustration. If they were a villager, they might have latched onto something, or tried to rally us.\n\nVOTE: Agent4",

We are down to the final three: Agent0, Agent3, and Agent4.\n\nLast night, Agent0 voted for me, Agent1 voted \"NOONE\", and Agent4 voted \"NOONE\". My vote was for Agent1, which unfortunately didn't lead to an elimination. The fact that Agent1 was killed last night, and it was the werewolves who did it, confirms they are still active and are now closer to winning.\n\nWe have Agent0, Agent3, and Agent4 remaining. One of us is a werewolf. The previous day's discussion was very cautious, with many voting \"NOONE.\" Agent0 had focused on Agent6's comment about Agent2, and I voted for Agent0, thinking they might be trying to expose the werewolf or a werewolf trying to deflect. Agent4 was generally frustrated with the lack of progress.\n\nSince Agent1 was killed, and I am Agent3, it is highly probable that either Agent0 or Agent4 is the werewolf. Or, if there were two werewolves, they have now successfully eliminated all villagers.\n\nConsidering the votes from the last day: Agent0 voted for me (Agent3). I voted for Agent0. Agent1 and Agent4 voted NOONE. This split means no one was eliminated yesterday. The werewolves then made their move last night.\n\nNow, it's a 3-way situation. If Agent0 is the werewolf, and I am a villager, then voting for Agent4 would be the logical step for Agent0 to try and win. If Agent4 is the werewolf, and I am a villager, then voting for Agent0 would be the logical step for Agent4 to win. If I am the werewolf, I need to decide between Agent0 and Agent4.\n\nAgent0's earlier focus on Agent6's comment felt like a genuine attempt to analyze. Agent4's consistent frustration and desire for leads, without making strong accusations, could be either a villager's desperation or a werewolf playing it safe.\n\nGiven that Agent0 voted for me yesterday, and I voted for Agent0, there's a direct conflict. Agent4 abstained from voting. This makes Agent4 seem less directly involved in the previous day's tension. I need to make a choice that either eliminates a suspected werewolf or creates enough division to allow me to survive.\n\nIf I believe Agent0 is the werewolf, I should vote for them. If I believe Agent4 is the werewolf, I should vote for them.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. Agent0's earlier comment about Agent6 pointing out a \"good player\" was followed by Agent6's death. My vote for Agent0 was based on this chain of events. Agent4 consistently expressed frustration. Agent1 was consistently cautious. The fact that Agent1 was killed means the werewolves are working effectively.\n\nI am Agent3. I need to make a decision that benefits me. If Agent0 is the werewolf, they will likely vote for me or Agent4. If Agent4 is the werewolf, they will likely vote for me or Agent0.\n\nAgent0 has been the most analytical, trying to piece things together. This could be a villager's attempt to win, or a werewolf trying to appear helpful. Agent4 has been less vocal but consistently pushing for action.\n\nLet's assume, for a moment, that Agent0 is the werewolf. They voted for me yesterday. If they vote for me again, and Agent4 votes for me, then I'm out. If Agent0 votes for Agent4, and Agent4 votes for Agent0, and I vote for Agent4, then Agent4 is out.\n\nIf Agent4 is the werewolf, they will vote for me or Agent0. My safest bet might be to target the person who has been most active in trying to analyze and potentially expose the werewolf, which is Agent0. This way, if Agent0 is the werewolf, I eliminate them. If Agent0 is a villager, then it's a calculated risk, but it also makes me seem like I'm trying to find the truth.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
