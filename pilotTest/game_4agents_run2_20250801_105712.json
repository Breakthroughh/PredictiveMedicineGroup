If they are a villager, they are actively trying to find us. If they are a werewolf, they are making a bold, possibly miscalculated, move. Either way, eliminating Agent0 seems like the most prudent course of action to maintain our advantage and silence the one who's already pointed a finger.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
