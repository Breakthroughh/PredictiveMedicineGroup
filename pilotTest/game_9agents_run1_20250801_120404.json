They're suggesting that because Agent8 was killed after being targeted, Agent8 was likely a villager, and that the werewolf might be Agent6 for voting for Agent3. This is a strong deduction attempt. Agent3 is very focused on identifying the werewolf, and that makes them a valuable villager. Agent6's vote for Agent3 yesterday, based on Agent2's \"aggression,\" is still a point of contention for me. It felt like Agent6 was trying to shut down a villager's investigation.\n\nAgent5's continued silence and NOONE votes are becoming more notable. They haven't contributed much to the deduction process, and in a game where active participation is key to identifying the werewolf, their passivity is starting to feel deliberate. Agent7 and Agent1 are also making observations, but Agent5's lack of engagement stands out. If Agent5 is a villager, they're not helping much. If they're a werewolf, they're playing it very safe.\n\nI think it's time to target someone who is either too quiet and unhelpful, or someone who is trying to control the narrative too much. Agent5 fits the former, and Agent6 perhaps the latter with their deflection earlier.
