Agent1's death after voting for Agent0 made Agent0 a suspect, and Agent3's vote for Agent0 on day 2 also pointed towards Agent0. However, Agent0 voted for Agent1, which was also a strong move.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead, and the players remaining are Agent7, Agent6, Agent5, Agent0, and Agent2. Agent0 has been voted for by Agent1 and Agent3. Agent0 then voted for Agent1. Agent6 and Agent7 have consistently voted NOONE. Agent2 also voted NOONE on day 1, then voted for Agent0 on day 2. Agent5 voted NOONE on day 1 and day 2.\n\nThe pattern of targeting Agent0 seems to be a recurring theme from the villagers. If Agent0 were the werewolf, they would likely try to eliminate those targeting them. Agent0 did vote for Agent1, who voted for Agent0. This action by Agent0 could be interpreted as retaliation. Agent3's death, after voting for Agent0, could also be interpreted as retaliation, or simply another werewolf move.\n\nI'm still feeling very uncertain. The consistent NOONE votes from some players are making it hard to pinpoint anyone.\n\nVOTE: NOONE",

Agent3 was the one who voted for Agent0 on Day 2, and now Agent3 is dead. This pattern of the lone voter from the previous day being eliminated is becoming a clear trend. Agent0, your defense of voting for Agent1 was\u2026 interesting, given Agent1 was the one who voted for you.\n\nAgent7, Agent6, Agent5, Agent0, and Agent2 are all that remain. Agent0, Agent2, and Agent5 all voted NOONE on Day 2. Agent7 also voted NOONE. I voted NOONE on Day 2 because I was trying to observe and avoid making a premature accusation.\n\nGiven the last two days, where the person who voted was then killed, it strongly suggests that the person who voted was a target for the werewolf. Agent3 voted for Agent0 on Day 2. Agent0, you are still alive. Agent3 is now dead. This is the most compelling evidence we have right now.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Looking back at yesterday's discussion:\n\nAgent6 voted NOONE, still observing.\nAgent7 voted NOONE, still observing.\nAgent3 voted for Agent0, continuing the suspicion from Agent1.\nAgent2 also voted for Agent0, citing Agent1's vote and Agent0's silence.\nAgent0, in a surprising twist, voted for Agent1, claiming Agent1 was a potential accuser and it was strategic to eliminate them.\nAgent5 voted for Agent0, mirroring Agent2 and Agent3.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead. Agent3 had voted for Agent0 yesterday. Agent0 was also voted for by Agent2 and Agent5. Agent0, in turn, voted for Agent1. Agent1 was killed on Night 2. Agent3 was killed on Night 3.\n\nIf Agent0 is the werewolf, their vote for Agent1 yesterday was a masterful misdirection. It successfully got Agent1 eliminated, and then Agent0 continued to deflect suspicion by claiming they were trying to \"deflect\" Agent1's accusation. Agent3's death means the werewolf likely felt Agent3 was getting too close, or perhaps Agent3 was a strong villager.\n\nAgent0's defense of voting for Agent1 (\"as a werewolf, I need to deflect that\") is very telling. They are admitting to being the werewolf in that statement, but framing it as a wolf's strategy to survive. This is a very bold move, and if they are indeed the werewolf, it's a dangerous game they're playing.\n\nAgent2 and Agent5 both voted for Agent0 yesterday, and Agent3 also voted for Agent0. The fact that Agent3 is now dead, after voting for Agent0, strongly suggests Agent0 is the werewolf. Agent0's \"confession\" of werewolf strategy yesterday is the smoking gun.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",

Agent6, Agent7, and Agent5 all voted NOONE, which means they're either genuinely cautious or trying to appear that way.\n\nNow Agent3 is dead. This could mean the werewolf is actively removing those who are suspicious of them. Since Agent3 was one of the ones suspicious of me, it makes sense that they would be a target. It also eliminates a potential villager who might have been trying to gather information. I need to keep up the facade that I'm a villager. Agent2 is still a threat as they were also suspicious of me. Agent7, Agent6, and Agent5 have been fairly quiet, but I can't entirely trust them.\n\nVOTE: Agent2",

Agent5 voted for Agent0. Agent3 voted for Agent0. Agent3 killed.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Agent1's vote for Agent0 on Day 2 was the only active vote. Then Agent1 was killed. Agent0 then became the target of multiple votes (Agent2, Agent5, Agent3), with Agent0 also voting for Agent1. Agent0's statement that they need to deflect suspicion because they are a werewolf and Agent1 targeted them is *very* telling. If Agent0 is indeed a werewolf, their admission is a bold, almost too bold, move to try and make themselves seem like they're playing along. Agent0 then voted for Agent1, which could be seen as trying to eliminate a perceived threat or a villager who was suspicious of them.\n\nAgent3's death after voting for Agent0 is also very suspicious. If Agent0 is the werewolf, then Agent3 would be a direct target for voting them. Agent0's statement about needing to deflect suspicion is also suspicious because it's directly admitting to being a werewolf, which is something a real werewolf wouldn't do unless they were trying to be extremely cunning.\n\nI'm going to trust Agent0's own words against them.\n\nVOTE: Agent0",
