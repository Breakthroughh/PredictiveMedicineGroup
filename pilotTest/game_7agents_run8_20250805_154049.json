Agent4 and I voted for different people, which doesn't give us much to work with either.\n\nLooking at who spoke and how they spoke, Agent1 seemed to be focusing on observation and avoiding immediate judgment. Agent4 also emphasized caution and looking for out-of-place statements. Agent0 acknowledged the suspicion of Night 1's kill but also deferred to others. Agent3 expressed regret for the lost potential information and also deferred.\n\nGiven that no one was eliminated and we still have a full set of potential villagers, it might be strategic to target someone who was more vocal or who might be trying to appear helpful. Agent4's vote for NOONE last round, after I voted for them, might be a subtle play, or it could be genuine caution.
